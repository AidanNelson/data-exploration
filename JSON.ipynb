       "    'description': ['<p>Contains 277 documents relating to the work of Congress and  the drafting and ratification of the Constitution.  Items include  extracts of the journals of Congress, resolutions, proclamations,  committee reports, treaties, and early printed versions of the <a href=\"/resource/bdsdcc.c0801\">United States Constitution</a> and the <a href=\"/resource/bdsdcc.02101\">Declaration of Independence</a>. Most broadsides are one page in length; others range from 1 to 28 pages. A number of  these items contain manuscript annotations not recorded elsewhere that  offer insight into the delicate process of creating consensus. In many  cases, multiple copies bearing manuscript annotations are available to  compare and contrast. </p> <h2>Introduction</h2> <p>The Broadside Collection in the Rare Book Division of the Library of  Congress consists of approximately 40,000 items dating from 1527 to the  present but predominantly featuring 18th- and 19th-century Americana.  Most of the 18th-century items were preserved because of the foresight  of Ebenezer Hazard and Peter Force. Hazard was a historian and collector  of papers relating to the European settlements in North America.    Force, a historian and collector, published <em>American Archives</em>, a  compilation of early American documents from 1774-76.  Force acquired  parts of Hazard\\'s collection to add to his library.  The Library of  Congress purchased the Peter Force Library in 1867, establishing its  first major collections of 18th-century American newspapers, incunabula,  early American imprints, manuscripts, and rare maps and atlases.   Complementing the Continental Congress and Constitutional Convention  Broadside Collections are at least 2,000 additional items dating from  1774 to 1789 that include proceedings and proclamations of state and  local governmental bodies, public notices, petitions, and polemic  essays, as well as proceedings of various British offices relating to  America.</p> <p>This online collection, one of the earliest in American Memory, was  first released in 1995 with bitonal images scanned from microfilm. The  Library of Congress upgraded this collection in 2005 by providing access  to full color scans of the original, for at least one copy of each  broadside. In some cases, duplicate copies bearing manuscript  annotations exist in the collection. The Library scanned these  distinctive copies and is making them accessible as part of the  collection upgrade.</p> <h2>What is a Broadside?</h2> <p> A broadside, or broadsheet, is a large sheet of paper, usually  printed only on one side. This format is often used for rapid  distribution of time-dated ephemeral information and is intended to be  read and shared or thrown away. Especially popular in the 18th-century,  the broadside format was used for a variety of purposes, including  official notices, proclamations, petitions, playbills, news extras, and  advertisements. Broadsides were posted in town halls and coffee houses,  read in churches and public meetings, and often reprinted or excerpted  in local newspapers. </p> <h2>The Continental Congress Broadside Collection </h2> <p>The Continental Congress Broadside Collection, consisting of 256  titles, includes material relating to the work of Congress, dating from  1774 to 1788. Items are predominantly extracts of the journals of  Congress, resolutions, committee reports, proclamations, treaties, and  other congressional proceedings. These broadsides provide a significant  supplement to the <em>Journals of the Continental Congress</em>. Some of  the broadsides trace the evolution of congressional measures at  specific stages of consideration and differ significantly from the  modified resolutions finally adopted by Congress. Some items contain  manuscript annotations not recorded elsewhere that offer insight into  the delicate process of creating consensus. In many cases, multiple  copies bearing manuscript annotations are available to compare and  contrast. Not every major topic considered by Congress is represented by  this collection; the bulk of the material dates from 1781 to 1788. </p> <p>Most of the items in the collection are composed of a single sheet,  meeting the classic definition of a broadside. Some items, however,  range in length to 28 pages. All of these broadsides, many of which were  acquired in 1867 from Peter Force--historian, collector, and compiler  of <em>American Archives</em>--are in the Rare Book and Special  Collections Division, with the exception of one broadside, which is in  the Manuscript Division.</p> <h2>The Constitutional Convention Broadside Collection </h2> <p> The Constitutional Convention Broadside Collection (21 titles) dates  from 1786 to 1789 and includes documents relating to the Constitutional  Convention of 1787, extracts of proceedings of state assemblies and  conventions relating to the ratification of the Constitution, and  several essays on ratification. </p> <p>Most of the items in the collections are composed of a single sheet,  meeting the classic definition of a broadside. Some items, however,  range in length to twenty-eight pages. All of these broadsides, many of  which were acquired in 1867 from Peter Force, are in the <a href=\"//www.loc.gov/rr/rarebook/\">Rare Book and Special Collections Division</a>, with the exception of one broadside, which is in the <a href=\"//www.loc.gov/rr/mss/\">Manuscript Division</a>. </p>'],\n",

       "    'description': ['<p>This online collection is drawn from three primary sources: <em>The War of the Nations: Portfolio in Rotogravure Etchings,</em> a volume published by the <em>New York Times</em> shortly after the armistice that compiled selected images from their \"Mid-Week Pictorial\" supplements of 1914-19; Sunday rotogravure sections from the <em>New York Times </em>for 1914-19; and Sunday rotogravure sections from the <em>New York Tribune </em>for 1916-19.</p> <figure class=\"image-align-left\"><a href=\"/resource/sn78004456/1915-05-23/ed-1/?sp=5\"><img src=\"/collections/static/world-war-i-rotogravures/images/rotohome.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a> <figcaption>A French officer and his British ally at the front read the New York Times.</figcaption> </figure> <p><em>The War of Nations</em> is particularly rich. This volume contains 1,398 rotogravure images with brief descriptive captions, broad organizational headings, and a table of contents; 32 maps that describe military engagements throughout the war; and a 3-page appendix that provides a chronology, statistics, treaty excerpts, and highlights of wartime events.</p> <p>Rotogravure collections were chosen for digitization since few quality originals exist in newspaper format due to paper deterioration. Although microfilm of the<em> New York Times</em> and <em>Tribune</em> is readily available both in the Library\\'s Newspaper &amp; Current Periodical Room and in many libraries across the country, pictorial reproduction on microfilm is so poor as to make them unusable. Rotogravure images in particular are of such poor quality on microfilm that they fail to meet most user needs. Whole sections were digitized to faithfully represent integration of rotogravure pages with the rest of the New<em> York Times</em> and <em>New York Tribune</em> pictorial sections to demonstrate their use as attention getters next to less attractive pages.</p> <p>Scanned images of the<em> New York Times</em> pictorial sections of 1914-19 were taken from a collection of that paper\\'s volumes generously donated by Mrs. Sandra Baden to the Library of Congress\\'s Serial and Government Publications Division. Rotogravure sections of the <em>New York Tribune</em> were taken from the Division\\'s collection of bound volumes for scanning.</p> <p>Multiple copies of <em>The War of the Nations: Portfolio in Rotogravure Etchings</em> are available in the Library of Congress. In 1985 the Library prepared a microfilm edition from an original 1919 print copy of this volume; the printed illustrations reside in the Prints &amp; Photographs Division. A reprint edition dated 1977 is also available in the Library\\'s General Collections. The Serial and Government Publications Division received a donated copy of the 1919 edition from Mr. Daniel Pollen; this copy was used for scanning.</p>  <h2>Background and Scope</h2> <p>During the World War I era (1914-18), leading newspapers took advantage of a new printing process that dramatically altered their ability to reproduce images. Rotogravure printing, which produced richly detailed, high quality illustrations—even on inexpensive newsprint paper—was used to create vivid new pictorial sections. Publishers that could afford to invest in the new technology saw sharp increases both in readership and advertising revenue.</p> <p>The images in this collection track American sentiment about the war in Europe, week by week, before and after the United States became involved. Events of the war are detailed alongside society news and advertisements touting products of the day, creating a pictorial record of both the war effort and life at home. The collection includes an illustrated history of World War I selected from newspaper rotogravure sections that graphically documents the people, places, and events important to the war.</p>  <p>Pictorial sections, once limited to weeklies and periodicals, became part of the daily newspaper in the latter half of the nineteenth century. American newspapers competed for readers using investigative exposes, illustrations, and cartoons. William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer attracted new readers to their papers in the 1890s by using photoengraving to publish news photography.</p> <p>In the early 1900s, a specialized photoengraving process, that is, rotogravure printing, became the latest tool in the circulation wars. Capable of producing quality halftone reproductions of photography and artwork at a high speed, even on inexpensive newsprint paper, rotogravure printing allowed newspapers to bring high quality illustrations to the masses.</p> <p>First used in German newspapers, rotogravure was introduced to the American public by the <em>New York Times</em> in a special pictorial section for Christmas, 1912. Beginning March 29, 1914, the <em>Times</em> became one of six newspapers to regularly publish rotogravure art sections as a separate section of the newspaper, mid-week and on Sundays. In 1942 the rotogravure section became a part of its Sunday magazine. </p>  <p>During World War I (1914-18) rotogravure sections captured the details and intensity of the fighting, introduced technological innovations to a curious and interested American public, and documented the work and play of the home front. These pictorials were important tools for promoting U.S. propaganda and influenced how readers viewed world events. Images from the battlefields and dramatic coverage of casualties from the 1915 sinking of the<em> Lusitania</em> by a German U-boat contributed to the U.S. decision to join the war.</p> <p>The Sunday rotogravure sections of two of the most prominent U.S. newspapers of the day, the <em>New York Times </em> and <em>New York Tribune,</em> highlight the variety and diversity of pictorials. In addition to high quality photographs depicting noted personalities of the day, events during the war, celebrations and memorials, and high fashion and the arts, the sections include advertisements.&nbsp; Rotogravure pictorial sections proved very popular with readers, and more importantly, with advertisers. These sections became the most widely read section of the paper and provided a great opportunity to reach new customers.</p>'],\n",

       "    'description': [\"<h2>Sir Francis Drake</h2> <p>Sir Francis Drake's accomplishments as an explorer and naval strategist were unparalleled. His most notable feat was circumnavigating the earth from 1577-80, the first such voyage since Magellan's in 1522 and the only one up to that time captained by the same man from start to finish. Drake's expeditions to the Caribbean and the Pacific, undertaken during the circumnavigation and in subsequent voyages, revealed significant new geographical data about the New World and added greatly to Queen Elizabeth I's [1533-1603] treasury.</p>  <h2>The Collector</h2> <p>Assembled by Hans Peter Kraus and his wife Hanni in only twelve years, these materials reveal a great breadth and scope in the primary and secondary materials that concern Sir Francis Drake. Kraus was one of the foremost booksellers of the second half of the twentieth century. Born in Austria in 1907, he exhibited a precocious mind and a love of collecting from an early age—which soon turned to a love of collecting books. He became a bookseller under the traditional antiquarian Austrian guild system—first becoming an apprentice. In 1939, during the Nazi Occupation, Kraus and his family fled Austria for the United States. Within two weeks of his arrival in New York, Kraus met Hanni, his future wife and business partner. The couple established an antiquarian bookselling firm, H. P. Kraus, Inc., and amassed the stock and the connections needed for success. Their legendary firm opened in the early 1940s and did not close until 2003. The firm collected and sold many first rate editions.</p> <h2>The Collection</h2>  <p>In a 1968 James Ford Bell Lecture, Kraus explained how a chance comment about the enormous profit reaped by Sir Francis Drake and Queen Elizabeth from the around-the-world voyage piqued his interest and led him to study Drake's life. The more that Kraus learned, the more fascinated he became, and he resolved to put together a collection of contemporary materials related to Drake and his journeys. In 1980 Hans and Hanni Kraus generously donated their collection to the Rare Book and Special Collections Division of the Library of Congress. The combination of the Library's other rich collections from this period and the resources of the neighboring Folger Shakespeare Library make Washington a preeminent center for the study of the Elizabethan era.  The Kraus Collection consists of 60 items--16 manuscripts, 29 books, 8 maps and views, and 7 medals and portraits. The materials range in date from 1579 to 1765 and are written in English, Spanish, Latin, Italian, German, French, and Dutch.</p> <h3>Manuscripts</h3>  <p>Manuscripts range in date from 1579 to 1603. They are mostly correspondence between various governing officials and diplomats of the Spanish and English crowns regarding Drake's activities in Spanish America and are written in Spanish, English, Latin, and Italian. Many of the other documents concern legal or financial topics, including the record of Drake's sale of a 71-year lease of a house called the &quot;The Herbar.&quot;</p> <h3>Books</h3>  <p>Books range in date from 1581 to 1695 and are published in Spanish, English, Latin, German, French, and Dutch. Topics include general histories of exploration, trade, and navigation on the high seas including Drake's circumnavigation of the world. Other topics are of a more political nature and either extol Drake's accomplishments or decry his plunders in Spanish America. Still other accounts are biographies of the crowned heads Queen Elizabeth I and King Philip II [1527-1598].</p> <h3>Maps and views</h3>  <p>Maps and views range in date from 1570 to 1765 and were created by Spanish, Belgian, and English cartographers. Spanish America is depicted with drawings of fortresses and harbors as well as with maps of St. Augustine, South America, and the West Indies. There are also drawings depicting the Spanish Armada and the sea battles between the Spanish and the English. There is also a map of the world with an engraving of Drake and a map of Devonshire, England.</p> <h3>Medals and Portraits</h3>  <p>Medals and portraits range in date from 1583 to 1598 and are English, Spanish, and Dutch in origin. Two engraved medals commemorate the defeat of the Spanish Armada and two medals by Michael Mercator depict engravings of the world. There is also an engraving of Drake on paper, a series of portraits of sea explorers, and an oil portrait of Lord William Cecil Burghley, Queen Elizabeth I's secretary from 1558 to 1572.</p>\"],\n",

Also included is the thirty-two-volume  set of manuscript sources entitled <em>Early Western Travels, 1748-1846</em>, published between  1904 and 1907 after diligent compilation by the distinguished historian and secretary of the  Wisconsin Historical Society Reuben Gold Thwaites.   Although many of the authors represented  in <em>American Notes</em> are not widely known, the collection includes works by major figures such as  Matthew Arnold, Fredrika Bremer, William Cullen Bryant, François-René de Chateaubriand, William  Cobbett, James Fenimore Cooper, J. Hector St. John de Crèvecoeur, Charles Dickens, Washington  Irving, Benjamin Henry Latrobe, Sir Charles Lyell, William Lyon Mackenzie, André Michaux,  Thomas Nuttall, Frederick Law Olmsted, and Robert Louis Stevenson.  The narratives in <em>American Notes</em> therefore range from the  unjustly neglected to the justly famous, and from classics of the genre to undiscovered gems.   Together, they build a mosaic portrait of a young nation. </p>  <p><em>American Notes </em> is the fifth in a series of local history collections presented as part of the Library of Congress\\'s American Memory program, joining <a href=\"//memory.loc.gov/ammem/cbhtml/cbhome.html\"><em>\"California As I Saw It</em></a><em>,\"</em> <em><a href=\"/collections/pioneering-the-upper-midwest/about-this-collection/\">Pioneering the Upper Midwest</a>,</em> <em><a href=\"/collections/puerto-rico-books-and-pamphlets/about-this-collection/\">Puerto Rico at the Dawn of the Modern Age</a></em>,  and <a href=\"/collections/washington-and-chesapeake-bay-narratives/about-this-collection/\"><em>The Capital and The Bay</em></a>. Together, these online collections make up a virtual local history bookshelf in intellectually and electronically accessible form.</p>  <p>Three criteria  determined selection: in order to be included, a work had to be written primarily in the first person, free of copyright restrictions,  and part of the Library\\'s General Collections. These criteria follow closely those used in previous local history collections from American  Memory.</p>  <p>As in previous collections, there are regrettable limitations in the range of voices represented in <em>American Notes</em>.  Most obviously, there is a dearth of works from Native Americans, African Americans, and  other racial and ethnic minorities arising from the circumstances of history that severely constrained the number of books  published by members of these groups during the time that the collection covers. Certainly there were people in these groups who  published, and within the confines of the selection criteria, such works are included when possible.</p>'],\n",

       "    'description': ['<p>Work, school, and leisure activities in the United States from 1894 to 1915 are featured in this presentation of 150 motion pictures. Highlights include films of the United States Postal Service from 1903, cattle breeding, fire fighters, ice manufacturing, logging, calisthenic and gymnastic exercises in schools, amusement parks, boxing, expositions, football, parades, swimming, and other sporting events.</p> <p><em>America at Work, America at Leisure: Motion Pictures from 1894-1915</em> consists of 150 motion pictures, 62 of which also appear in other online collections. The majority of the films are from the Paper Print Collection, while the remainder are from the George Kleine Collection, both residing in the Motion Picture, Broadcasting and Recorded Sound Division (M/B/RS) of the Library of Congress. Both of these collections have printed catalogs available in the Motion Picture and Television Reading Room at the Library. The films were selected from these two collections on the basis of the activities pictured in the films and the quality of the available prints. As many different types of work, school, and leisure activities as could be found were sought in order to show the broadest possible representation of activities at the turn of the century. The selection is limited, however, by what is available from these collections; not every possible occupation or leisure activity from the turn of the century is represented. </p> <p>The films in the Paper Print Collection were deposited for copyright from 1894 to 1912 as positive pictures on paper. Many were deposited in this manner on paper rolls frame by frame. For preservation and access purposes, the Library of Congress has made 16mm prints of these Paper Print titles, and has more recently been making 35mm prints of selected titles. For this presentation, 35mm and 16mm prints have been used as the original source material for digitization. Many of the 35mm prints have been produced especially for this Web presentation. </p> <p>The George Kleine Collection consists of films obtained by film distributor and producer George Kleine. The collection includes films produced from 1898 to 1926, representing films by the Edison Company, French and Italian imports, and those produced by Kleine. The collection contains both 35mm and 16mm prints. </p> <p>Links to films in other online collections, such as <em>Inside an American Factory: The Westinghouse Works, 1904</em>;<em> The Last Days of a President: McKinley and the Pan-American Exposition</em>; and <em>Inventing Entertainment: The Early Motion Pictures and Sound Recordings of the Edison Companies</em> are also in the presentation to add further diversity to the films listed. </p> <p>The online collection offers films available in MPEG, QuickTime, and MP4. In the case of the first two formats, films are segmented when longer than four minutes so that file sizes will not be prohibitively large to download.</p>'],\n",

       "    'description': ['<p>The collection contains, among other materials, posters, playbills,  songsheets, notices, invitations, proclamations, petitions, timetables,  leaflets, propaganda, manifestos, ballots, tickets, menus, and business cards.  There are more than 28,000 items in the collection with 10,172 available online. The material dates  from the seventeenth century to the present day and covers innumerable  topics.</p>  <p>The library of Peter Force, acquired by the Library of Congress in 1867,  furnished the basis of the Printed Ephemera Collection. Force himself had  secured many of the pieces assembled by an earlier American historian and  collector, Ebenezer Hazard. The majority of the items in the collection were  produced in America and their major strength is in historical Americana. In  adding to the collection, the Library\\'s aim was to accumulate a record of all  broadsides printed in America, and to do so, photostats as well as originals  were collected.</p>  <p><em> Printed  Ephemera: Three Centuries of Broadsides and Other Printed Ephemera</em> delivers online access to the Printed Ephemera Collection,  providing digital images and searchable  text. </p>  <h3>The Nature of Ephemera</h3>  <p>As the name would suggest, printed ephemera tends to be transitory documents  created for a specific purpose, and intended to be thrown away. <em>The Printed  Ephemera Collection</em> at the Library of Congress comprises primary sources  relating to the key events of American history, including the Revolutionary War,  slavery, the Western land rush, the Civil War, women\\'s suffrage, and the  Industrial Revolution. The printed material was produced as the events unfolded  and offers unique snapshots of the nation\\'s past.</p>  <p>Printed ephemera has had multiple purposes, as instanced by the variety of  material assembled in the online collection<em>.</em> A primary purpose was the  distribution of information. In the days before television and radio, citizens  received news by way of broadsides and printed ephemera. For example, <a href=\"/item/94207357/\">a  Baltimore broadside</a> of 1776 gives the first published account of Washington  crossing the Delaware. </p>  <p>Other material tells a different story. Many of the items were never meant to  be kept. For example, an <a href=\"/item/rbpe.02803100/\">ordinary  paint advertisement</a> may not seem of historical interest except for the date:  1792. The list of colors (more than one might expect) gives clues about the  shades and hues that adorned the homes of the nation\\'s founders. A 1928 <a href=\"/item/rbpe.01806000/\">railroad  leaflet</a> includes one of the earliest references to air travel, and shows the  industry in a nascent, and interesting, state. </p>  <p>Printed ephemera also shows a new side of well-known issues and people. A <a href=\"/item/rbpe.0180070a/\">business  card</a> which appears to have been printed by Abraham Lincoln was actually  published and distributed by his opposition in the 1864 presidential election.  It promised that, after losing the election, he\\'d return to Illinois to split  rails and trade horses. </p>  <p>Historical events are brought to life by printed ephemera. In the wake of the  San Francisco earthquake and fire of 1906, Mayor E. E. Schmitz had no choice but  to muster a special police force to keep peace amid the chaos. He empowered the  officers to take extreme measures if necessary, and a <a href=\"/item/rbpe.00202500/\">broadside</a> announced the order. </p>  <p>Lastly, certain items provide a connection with the past in ways that  textbooks cannot. An 1840 poster for <a href=\"/item/rbpe.01602900/\">a  lost dog</a>, printed in Alton, Illinois, shows that people felt as strongly  about their pets in the nineteenth century as today. It also may spark a new consciousness  of one\\'s surroundings: the photocopied sign at the bus stop showing maps and routes  might be insignificant now, but it holds a story that may help to illuminate  history in generations to come. </p>  <p>In exploring the contents of <em>Printed Ephemera</em>, readers may  encounter attitudes and language that are jarring to contemporary sensibilities.  It should be noted that broadsides and printed ephemera express the language,  experience, and viewpoints of the era in which they were published.</p>  <h3>The Printed Ephemera Collection: In the Library\\'s Reading Room and Online</h3>  <p>The majority of the Printed Ephemera Collection at the Library is arranged by  state of imprint. The states are ordered alphabetically, and within each state,  the items are arranged chronologically. The sequence of American material is  followed by international imprints ordered by country, and special classes of  material grouped under a common subject, such as the Continental Congress and  Constitutional Convention broadsides, Lincoln material, and playbills. </p>  <p>The collection is housed in archival folders and placed in flat boxes and map  cases. Readers visiting the Library may use the card file or the published  catalog and make their requests at the front desk of the Rare Book and Special Collections Reading Room.</p>  <p>Users may browse or search keywords in the collection, make selections, and  download the images. Each item included in the online collection has been  digitized in a manner that captures all data on the item. Duplicate copies have  usually not been digitized, nor have surfaces of items that are blank or only  contain Library of Congress information that is reproduced in the bibliographic  description. </p>  <p>Often materials of this sort were produced in such a way that more than one  page of text was printed on one side of a sheet. These sheets were then folded  before distribution so the different pages of text followed each other in  appropriate order. These multiple formats are described in the section <a href=\"/collections/broadsides-and-other-printed-ephemera/articles-and-essays/page-order-and-folding-diagrams/\">Page Order and Folding  Diagrams</a>. The multiple printing formats and folding patterns represented in  the <em>Printed Ephemera</em> are described in the section Page Order and  Folding Diagrams. Original items in these various formats have been digitized  page by page in the order depicted in the applicable Page Order Diagram. </p>  <h3>The Printed Ephemera Collection: Bibliographic Access</h3>  <p>The majority of the <em>Printed Ephemera Collection</em> at the Library has brief  item-level descriptions. Occasionally a group of similar items is covered by a  single record. Some material has had complete cataloging and is described by  MARC records that reside in the Library\\'s online catalog; this comprises only a  small percentage of the collection, however. </p>  <p>Because printed ephemera lacks the uniformity of books, the traditional rules  of cataloging books and other monographs often do not apply. After all,  broadsides don\\'t have title pages. This may explain the simple, and at times  irregular, rendering of the titles in the bibliographic descriptions. For the  most part, these descriptions are not part of the Library\\'s official catalog,  but they remain an invaluable resource. </p>  <p>The collection is shelved in a geographical order, but the card file  maintains cross-referenced access in a total of three ways: geographical,  author/title, and chronological. All three were published in a four-volume set  entitled <em><a href=\"https://lccn.loc.gov/72006563\">Broadsides in the Rare Book Division, Library of Congress</a></em> (Boston: G.K. Hall, 1972), edited by Frederick Goff. </p>  <p><em>The Printed Ephemera Collection,</em> in addition to making printed ephemera  available online, will greatly enhance users\\' access to the collection by  offering keyword searchability, unlocking substantially increased research  potential.  The potential expands even farther with the full textual  transcriptions that are included. These \"full-text\" searches locate occurrences  anywhere in the entire document. </p>  <h3>The Printed Ephemera Collection: In Print and Online</h3>  <p>All information on the catalog cards has been transcribed in the  digital records. Even the backs of the cards, which are not visible in the  published finding aid, are accounted for in the bibliographical records that  accompany the images in this collection.</p>'],\n",

       "    'description': ['<p>This online collection offers complete page images of the 396 titles in the African American Pamphlet Collection,   as well as searchable electronic texts and bibliographic records. The digitization   of the collection was made possible by a major gift from the Citigroup Foundation. </p> <p>The African American Pamphlet Collection was accessioned in 1990-91 from a miscellaneous pamphlet collection in the <a href=\"//lcweb.loc.gov/rr/rarebook/\">Rare Book and Special Collections Division</a>.   The pamphlets were published from 1824 through 1909.  Most were  written by African-American authors, though some were written by others  on topics of particular importance in African-American history.  The  pamphlets were published in many formats using a wide variety of papers,  typefaces, and printing methods.  Many contain more than one gathering  (grouping of leaves or sheets) and have color covers with ornamental  borders or frames.  A small number include illustrations or other  graphics, such as bar graphs.  The physical size of the pamphlets ranges  from 15 to 26 centimeters.  The entire collection comprises  approximately eleven thousand pages and is housed in thirty-two boxes  labeled A-W.  Within the boxes, the pamphlets are stored in mylar  sleeves labeled with the collection name and the item identification  number. </p> <p>Seventeen of the collection\\'s titles, and many of its authors, can also be found in <a href=\"/collections/daniel-a-p-murray-pamphlets-from-1818-to-1907/\"><em>African American Perspectives: Pamphlets from the Daniel A. P. Murray Collection, 1818-1907</em></a>.  Like the Murray Pamphlet Collection, the African American Pamphlet  Collection presents a panoramic and eclectic overview of many aspects of  African-American history and culture.  The collection includes  first-person accounts of slavery, tracts from anti-slavery  organizations, legislative and presidential campaign materials,  investigative reports, sermons, commencement addresses, organizational  proceedings, and previously published materials from newspapers and  magazines.  Among the noted authors represented are Frederick Douglass,  Lydia Maria Child, Alexander Crummell, Kelly Miller, Charles Sumner,  Mary Church Terrell, and Booker T. Washington. </p> <p>The African American Pamphlet Collection was selected for  digitization because of the historical significance and rarity of its  contents, as well as its complementary value to other American Memory  collections, most notably <em>African American Perspectives</em>. </p> <p>In exploring the contents of <em>From Slavery to Freedom</em>,  readers may encounter attitudes and language that are jarring to  contemporary sensibilities. It should be noted that these materials  express the language, experience, and viewpoints of the era in which  they were written. </p>'],\n",

       "    'description': ['<p>A panoramic and eclectic review of African-American history  and culture, spanning almost one hundred years from the early nineteenth through the early twentieth  centuries, with the bulk of the material published between 1875 and  1900.  Among the authors represented are Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington, Ida B. Wells-Barnett,  Benjamin W. Arnett, Alexander Crummel, and Emanuel Love.</p> <h2>Introduction</h2> <p>The 351 titles in the collection include sermons on racial pride and  political activism; annual reports of charitable, educational, and  political organizations; and college catalogs and graduation orations  from the Hampton Institute, Morgan College, and Wilberforce University.   Also included are biographies, slave narratives, speeches by members of  Congress, legal documents, poetry, playbills, dramas, and librettos.   Other pamphlets focus on segregation, voting rights, violence against  African-Americans, and the colonization of Africa by freed slaves.   Several of the pamphlets are illustrated with portraits of the authors.</p> <p>Researcher LaVerle B. Berry (Library of Congress Federal Research  Division) compiled the annotations for the pamphlets included in the  catalog for the collection.  Berry noted three recurring themes that  present themselves throughout the Murray pamphlets. </p> <p>The first of these themes involves the desire to \"uplift\" the  black race in the United States and to \"improve\" the status of African  Americans.  This concern is almost always described in terms of the  attainment of social, cultural, and material achievements in order to  gain the respect of and equality with whites. </p> <p>A second theme is encompassed by the struggle for civil rights  and equality in the South.  This is most often embodied as an appeal to  the federal government to defend the constitutional rights of African  Americans and protect them from lynchings, executions without trials,  and other violence at the hands of southern mobs.  At the same time, the  necessity for blacks to obey the law is constantly affirmed. </p> <p>The third theme questions the future of freed American slaves --  should they remain in the U.S. as freedmen or emigrate to the colony of  Liberia in Africa?  Several pamphlets mention the American Colonization  Society and other such groups who supported the repatriation of freed  slaves to Africa in an effort to establish and nourish the new colony.</p> <p>Berry further observed a broad range of opinions expressed in the  pamphlets and the tensions between them. Concerning race relations, the  pamphlets reveal strong notes of discord between accommodationist points  of view and the supporters of a more militant stance.  Most pamphlets  lean more toward the former than the latter, although there are several  militant writers to be found among them. </p> <p>Also, pamphleteers focus primarily upon the problems of southern  African Americans rather than those in the North.  While northern blacks  are not ignored and the problems facing African Americans are more  often discussed in national terms, the overriding concern lies with the  attitudes of southern whites toward southern blacks.</p> <h2>Collection History</h2> <p id=\"murray\" name=\"murray\">Daniel A. P. Murray (1852-1925), an employee of the Library of Congress from 1871 to 1923,  was charged with the task of gathering books and pamphlets for the  Exhibit of Negro Authors at the 1900 Paris Exposition.  The volumes he  collected formed the nucleus of the Library\\'s Collection of Books by  Colored Authors.</p> <p>In 1926 the Library received a bequest of 1,448 books and pamphlets  that Murray had privately assembled.  These volumes were added to the  Colored Authors\\' Collection and were later integrated with the general  collections of the Library, with many duplicates being transferred to  Howard University.  Twenty-two volumes of bound pamphlets were  transferred to the Rare Books and Special Collections Division; these  volumes form the current Daniel A. P. Murray Pamphlet Collection.</p> <p>The volumes in the collection are labeled A to G and 12 to 28; it has  been assumed that volumes A to 28 represented a continuous set, with  the enumeration changing from numbers to letters.  An inventory dated  January 9, 1974, showed that the volumes that fall between G and 12, as  well as volume 27, are missing.  The arrangement of the pamphlets within  the volumes is not based on chronology or subject; although often a  number of works by the same author may appear in a single volume, the  arrangement is apparently little more than random.</p> <p>In 1990 the Daniel A. P. Murray Pamphlet Collection underwent phased  conservation treatment.  The volumes were disbound; the pages were  deacidified and buffered, mended and guarded; and, where needed, the  individual pages of each pamphlet were encapsulated.  The individual  pamphlets are now stored in acid-free boxes, the order of which  corresponds to that of the original volumes. </p> <p>There are now 386 pieces in the collection; all except the thirty-five duplicate titles have been digitized.</p> <h2>Daniel A. P. Murray</h2> <figure class=\"image-align-right\">  <img src=\"/collections/static/daniel-a-p-murray-pamphlets-from-1818-to-1907/images/photo03.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" />  <figcaption><em>Daniel A. P. Murray (1852 -1925).  Photographer unknown.  Photograph, undated.</em></figcaption> </figure> <p>Daniel Alexander Payne Murray (1852-1925) was born in Baltimore,  Maryland, the son of a freed slave.  At the age of nine, he moved to  Washington, D.C. to work for his brother, a caterer and manager of the  United States Senate Restaurant.  Ten years later, in 1871, Murray  became a member of the twelve-person staff of the Library of Congress as  the personal assistant to the Librarian of Congress, Ainsworth Rand  Spofford.  Murray was the second African-American to hold a professional  position at the Library of Congress.  In 1881, he was promoted to  assistant librarian.</p> <p>In 1899, Spofford\\'s successor, Herbert Putnam, asked Murray to  compile a collection of books and pamphlets by black authors for an  exhibition of \"Negro Authors\" at the 1900 Paris Exposition.  Murray  published a preliminary list of titles in 1900, appealing to the public  for donations of listed works, as well as suggested additions.  Within  several months, his list had grown to eleven hundred titles; his  collection became the core of the Library of Congress\\'s \"Colored  Authors\\' Collection.\"  Although Murray planned to expand his collection  and create an encyclopedia of African-American achievement, the project  never received sufficient support to become a reality.</p> <p>Murray was widely acknowledged as an authority on African-American  concerns.  He was the first African-American member of the Washington  Board of Trade, and he testified before the House of Representatives  about Jim Crow laws and the migration of African-Americans from rural  locations to urban areas.  He was twice a delegate to the Republican  National Convention and was a member of many other councils and  organizations.  He was also a prolific author, and a frequent  contributor to African-American journals, in particular <em>The Voice of the Negro.</em> Murray\\'s personal library of African-American works was bequeathed to the Library of Congress upon his death in 1925.</p>'],\n",

Twenty-three interviewees discuss how they felt about slavery, slaveholders, coercion of slaves, their families, and freedom. Several individuals sing songs, many of which were learned during the time of their enslavement. It is important to note that all of the interviewees spoke sixty or more years after the end of their enslavement, and it is their full lives that are reflected in these recordings. The individuals documented in this presentation have much to say about living as African Americans from the 1870s to the 1930s, and beyond. </p>  <p>All known recordings of former slaves in the American Folklife Center are included in this presentation. Some are being made publicly available for the first time. Unfortunately, not all the recordings are clearly audible. Although the original tapes and discs are generally in good physical condition, background noise and poorly positioned microphones make it extremely difficult to follow many of the interviews. It is important to note, that an additional 2300 non-audio interviews with ex-slaves are available online:<a href=\"https://memory.loc.gov/ammem/snhtml/snhome.html\"><em> Born in Slavery: Slave Narratives from the Federal Writers\\' Project, 1936-1938</em></a>. The contextual and interpretive material accompanying those interviews are often equally useful for understanding the recordings in this presentation.</p>  <p>Three of the recordings presented here were made for the Commonwealth of Virginia between 1937 and 1940 by Roscoe E. Lewis in affiliation with the Federal Writers\\' Project (FWP) of the Works Progress Administration (WPA). Another ten recordings are part of a 1300-disc collection donated to the Library by the American Dialect Society in 1984. Five of these interviews were recorded by Lorenzo Dow Turner in 1932 and 1933 in the Gullah areas of South Carolina and Georgia. The remainder were recorded by Archibald A. Hill and Guy S. Lowman in Virginia from 1934 to 1935.The remaining thirteen recordings were made by a number of different fieldworkers. The earliest came from a 1935 recording expedition to Georgia, Florida, and the Bahamas by Alan Lomax, Zora Neale Hurston, and Mary Elizabeth Barnicle. Their goal was to collect stories and music from African Americans in these areas. In 1940, John A. Lomax, who had recently been appointed honorary curator of the Library of Congress\\'s Archive of Folk Song, and his wife Ruby T. Lomax conducted interviews in Texas. These were followed by recordings made in 1941 by Robert Sonkin (in Alabama), and by John H. Faulk (in Texas) with support from a Rosenwald scholarship and the Library of Congress. In 1941, as part of a joint venture between the Library of Congress and Fisk University, Charles S. Johnson, Lewis W. Jones, John W. Work, and Alan and Elizabeth Lomax conducted interviews in Mississippi. Hermond Norwood, a Library of Congress engineer at the time, recorded an interview in 1949 in Maryland. The most recent interviews were conducted by Elmer E. Sparks in 1974 (in Texas) and 1975 (in Florida).</p>  <p>Efforts were made to collect biographical information about the interviewees and interviewers. Unfortunately, with few exceptions, only a small amount of information was found about the former slaves. A book and numerous newspaper and magazine articles were written about Charlie Smith, who lived to be 137. Fountain Hughes was interviewed by the Towson, Maryland, Jeffersonian in 1952 when he was 101. Transcripts of WPA interviews with <a href=\"https://dev.loc.gov/resource/mesn.143/seq-275\">Samuel Polite</a> and <a href=\"https://dev.loc.gov/resource/mesn.144/seq-198\">Dave White</a> and with <a href=\"https://dev.loc.gov/resource/mesn.163/seq-45\">Billy McCrea\\'s</a> brother are available, as are photographs and field notes related to several former slaves. However, for most of the ex-slaves, it is their interviews that provide the most complete information about them. More information is available about the people who conducted the interviews; summaries are found in <a href=\"https://dev.loc.gov/collections/stories-from-former-slaves/articles-and-essays/biographies-of-the-interviewers/\">Biographies  of the Interviewers</a>.</p>  <p>The recordings in this online collection provide an opportunity for linguists to examine the development of Black English and the transformation of language over time. Transcriptions of recordings received from the American Dialect Society are available for the first time in this presentation as are transcriptions of several other previously published interviews, including those made for the book <em>The Emergence of Black English: Text and Commentary</em>, edited by Guy Bailey, Natalie Maynor, and Patricia Cukor-Avila (Philadelphia: John Benjamins Publishing Co., 1991) and appear with slight modifications in this presentation. American Folklife Center staff transcribed the remaining recordings. The transcripts, for the most part, are presented in standard English; however, as the audio tracks attest, the speakers all render their stories in a variety of dialects that reflect their heritage. Recordings that suffer from poor audio quality have gaps in their transcriptions, but even in those cases, the transcriptions are a useful tool for following and understanding the interviews.</p>  <p>Twenty-eight songs (or song fragments) are included in the recordings. Many of the songs are difficult to identify because folk melodies and lyrics tend to change over time.<br>  </p>'],\n",

Initially, only four states involved    in the project (Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and Virginia) focused on collecting    the stories of people who had once been held in slavery. John A. Lomax, the    National Advisor on Folklore and Folkways for the FWP (and the curator of the    Archive of American Folk Song at the Library of Congress), was extremely interested    in the ex-slave material he received from these states. In 1937 he directed    the remaining states involved in the project to carry out interviews with former    slaves as well. Federal field workers were given instructions on what kinds    of questions to ask their informants and how to capture their dialects, the  result of which may sometimes be offensive to today\\'s readers (see <a href=\"/collections/slave-narratives-from-the-federal-writers-project-1936-to-1938/articles-and-essays/note-on-the-language-of-the-narratives/\">A Note on the Language of  the Narratives</a>).  The field workers    often visited the people they interviewed twice in order to gather as many recollections    as possible. Sometimes they took photographs of informants and their houses.    The interviewers then turned the narratives over to their state\\'s FWP director for    editing and eventual transfer to Washington, D.C. The <a href=\"/item/mesn001/\">administrative files</a> accompanying the narratives detail the information supplied to field  workers as well as subjects of concern to state directors of the FWP.  For more information about the interviewers, the people interviewed, and  the processes of collection and compilation, see <a href=\"/collections/slave-narratives-from-the-federal-writers-project-1936-to-1938/articles-and-essays/introduction-to-the-wpa-slave-narratives/\">Norman Yetman\\'s essay</a> which accompanies this online collection.</p>  <p>In 1939, the FWP lost its funding, and the states were ordered to send whatever    manuscripts they had collected to Washington. Once most of the materials had arrived at the Library of Congress, Benjamin A. Botkin, the folklore editor    of the FWP who later became head of the Archive of Folk Culture at the Library of Congress, undertook the remaining editing and indexing of the narratives and selected the photographs for inclusion. As noted above, he organized the    narratives by state, and then alphabetically by name of informant within each state, collecting them in 1941 into seventeen bound volumes in thirty-three parts under the title <em>Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the    United States from Interviews with Former Slaves</em> (Washington,  D.C., 1941).    The multivolume set and other project files, including some earlier unbound  annotated versions of the narratives, are housed in the  Manuscript Division and described in the  <a href=\"http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/eadmss.ms009053\">finding aid</a> for the records of the WPA.</p>  <p>Other records relating  to the ex-slave project are among the FWP files at the National  Archives and Records Administration (Record Group 69.5.5) and are  described in the <em>Guide to Federal Records in the National Archives of the United States, Vol. I</em>. (Washington, D.C.: National Archives and Records Administration, 1995).    Volumes 2-17 of <em>The American Slave: A Composite Autobiography</em>, edited by George P. Rawick and others (Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 1972-79), present these narratives with a slightly different organization; the later    volumes of Rawick\\'s series also include ex-slave interviews housed in other archives. Anthologies containing selections from the Library of Congress collection include the Federal Writers\\' Project\\'s <em>Lay My Burden Down: A Folk History    of Slavery</em>, edited by B. A. Botkin (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1945) and <em>Voices from Slavery</em> (New York:    Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1970), edited by Norman R. Yetman, author of  <a href=\"/collections/slave-narratives-from-the-federal-writers-project-1936-to-1938/articles-and-essays/introduction-to-the-wpa-slave-narratives/\">An Introduction to the WPA Slave Narratives</a> under the Articles and Essays tab.

It includes the complete collection of  Stern\\'s  contemporary newspapers, Lincoln\\'s law papers, sheet music, broadsides,   prints, cartoons, maps, drawings, letters, campaign tickets, and other   ephemeral items. The books and pamphlets in this collection are  scheduled for  digitization at a later date.</p>  <p>Alfred Whital Stern (1881-1960) of Chicago presented his  outstanding  collection of Lincolniana to the Library of Congress in 1953. Stern   began collecting in the 1920s. His collection documents the life of  Abraham  Lincoln (1809-1865) both through writings by and about Lincoln  as well as a  large body of publications concerning the issues of the  times including  slavery, the Civil War, Reconstruction, and related  topics. </p>  <p>Highlights of the online collection include Lincoln\\'s own   scrapbook of the 1858 political campaign against Stephen A. Douglas; the  Tiffany  seed pearl necklace and bracelets that Lincoln gave to his  wife, Mary Todd; a  Lincoln life mask cast in bronze by Clark Mills, as  well as the contents of  Lincoln\\'s pockets on the evening of his  assassination. Probably the single most  famous Lincoln manuscript in  the collection is the January 26, 1863, letter to  General Joseph  Hooker, placing him in command of the Army of the Potomac. </p>  <p>Alfred Whital Stern\\'s gift to the Library represents the   most extensive collection of Lincolniana ever assembled by a private   individual. </p>  <p>Below is a listing of the types of items  in the Alfred Whital Stern Collection of Lincolniana.</p>  <table class=\"table-bordered table-padded\">   <tr>    <th scope=\"col\">Types of Items in the     Collection</th>    <th scope=\"col\">Number of Items</th>   </tr>   <tr>    <td>Advertisements </td>    <td>302 </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td>Books </td>    <td>\\xa0 5 </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td>Broadsides </td>    <td>515 </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td>Correspondence </td>    <td>81 </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td>Ephemera </td>    <td>206 </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td>Government publications </td>    <td>33 </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td>Humor, satire </td>    <td>76 </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td>Legal cases and case notes </td>    <td>224 </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td>Letters </td>    <td>81 </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td>Manuscripts </td>    <td>298 </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td>Maps </td>    <td>\\xa0\\xa0 9 </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td>Newspapers </td>    <td>296 </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td>Pamphlets </td>    <td>\\xa0 9 </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td>Periodicals </td>    <td>290 </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td>Photographs </td>    <td>69 </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td>Poetry </td>    <td>57 </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td>Portraits </td>    <td>336 </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td>Postcards </td>    <td>\\xa0 9 </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td>Realia </td>    <td>24 </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td>Sheet music </td>    <td>249 </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td>Speeches </td>    <td>27 </td>   </tr>  </table>'],\n",

       "    'description': ['<p> Consisting of 104 motion pictures and four sound recordings, the majority of the motion pictures (87) are from the Theodore Roosevelt Association Collection in the Motion Picture, Broadcasting and Recorded Sound Division (M/B/RS) at the Library of Congress.</p> <p>Founded in 1919, the Theodore Roosevelt Association was organized to perpetuate the legacy of Theodore Roosevelt. As part of its mission, it amassed a collection of motion pictures relating to the life and times of the former president. The collection contained films of persons and events from the period in which he lived, as well as films which featured Roosevelt. Much of the footage was taken from newsreels and other actuality films of the time. The association also compiled some of this footage to make silent documentaries on various aspects of Roosevelt\\'s life, such as his trip on the River of Doubt in Brazil or the building of the Roosevelt Dam.</p> <p>In 1962, the Association gave its film collection of 381 titles to the Library of Congress, where it currently resides. A catalog for the entire collection which gave detailed information for each film was compiled in 1986 by Wendy White-Hensen and Veronica M. Gillespie. The collection as a whole serves as an important representation of the latter part of Roosevelt\\'s life before the motion picture cameras and of political and world events of the first two decades of the twentieth century. (More detailed information about this collection is available in the essay by Veronica M. Gillespie entitled T. R. on Film.)</p> <p>For the online presentation, a selection of eighty-seven films from the collection was chosen, based on the quality of the footage and the events pictured. There are numerous films in the collection with different versions, essentially the same with only slight differences in editing. In such cases, the copy determined to be the best and most complete was digitized for the online presentation. Films were also chosen to represent as many different times and phases of Roosevelt\\'s life and career as possible.</p> <p>The Theodore Roosevelt Association Collection is predominantly composed of footage made after his presidency. To amplify the few films in this collection that were made during his presidency, seventeen films from the <a href=\"/collections/films-of-westinghouse-works-1904/articles-and-essays/\">Paper Print Film Collection</a> in M/B/RS were added to the presentation. These films show Roosevelt in various public appearances which he made as president. Other films from the Paper Print Collection show Roosevelt in events relating to the Spanish-American War before he was elected president.</p> <p>The online presentation, then, contains films of Roosevelt from 1898 to 1919, and some films composed after his death, from 1919 until approximately 1928. The films are available in MPEG, Quick Time, and MP4 formats, and in the case of the first two formats, are segmented when longer than four minutes so that file sizes will not be prohibitively large to download. (More information about the procedure used to digitize the collection is available in Building the Digital Collection.)</p> <p>The following films appear in this presentation with the kind permission of the Theodore Roosevelt Association, which produced them:</p> <ul>  <li>The Story of the Panama Canal [1]</li>  <li>T. R.\\'s Return from Africa, 1910 [2]</li>  <li>A Visit to Theodore Roosevelt at His Home at Sagamore Hill, Oyster Bay, L.I., 1912</li>  <li>Roosevelt, Friend of the Birds [1]</li>  <li>The Roosevelt Dam [1]</li>  <li>The River of Doubt [2].</li> </ul> <p>Permission may be needed from the association before using these films for other purposes. Contact the Theodore Roosevelt Association, P.O. Box 719, Oyster Bay, N.Y. 11771 by mail or by email at tra@sprynet.com.</p> <p>The four sound recordings selected for this presentation were made by Roosevelt for the Edison Company in 1912. In them, he states some of his progressive political ideas for the U.S. The speeches on these recordings were mostly excerpts from addresses Roosevelt had previously given. Transcriptions of these speeches were made both by listening to the recordings and by consulting Social Justice and Popular Rule: Essays, Addresses, and Public Statements Relating to the Progressive Movement (1910-1916) by Theodore Roosevelt.</p> <p>These recordings were originally made on cylinders and were then copied onto 1/4-inch magnetic tape. They were given to the Library of Congress by the Theodore Roosevelt Association in 1982. The recordings are available online in wav and RealAudio formats. </p>'],\n",

Together, these online collections make up a virtual local history bookshelf.  Like the other local history collections, <em>The Capital and the Bay</em> comprises first-person narratives, early histories, historical biographies, promotional brochures, and books of photographs in an attempt to capture in words and pictures a distinctive region as it developed between the onset of European settlement and the first quarter of the twentieth century.  Works published after that time generally pose copyright challenges that prevented their inclusion.</p>  <p>In addition to the bay itself, the Chesapeake Bay region is defined for the purposes of this collection as encompassing the portions of Maryland and Virginia from the Atlantic coast to the fall line where the region\\'s west-to-east-flowing rivers \"fall\" from the rolling piedmont to the flat coastal plain.  The region therefore includes the Eastern and Western Shores of the bay as well as the coastal plain in both states; the cities of Annapolis, Baltimore, Cambridge, Easton, and Havre de Grace in Maryland; the city of Washington and its environs, including the whole of the District of Columbia; and the cities of Alexandria, Fredericksburg, Norfolk, Hampton Roads, Petersburg, and Richmond in Virginia. These places share similarities in geography, economic life, and history because of the presence and influence of the bay and its tributaries. </p>  <p>They have also shared the historical influence of Washington, D.C., which as the nation\\'s capital has had a powerful effect upon the whole of the region surrounding it.  In the beginning, its regional impact was minor, for it was then the seat of government of a nation located on the fringe of the European world.  However, rapid growth in the wealth, size, and population of the United States was reflected in the evolution of a small provincial capital into a burgeoning center of national and world politics.  The ties that bind city and region are perhaps most dramatically illustrated in two wars whose theatres of action included the bay region.  The first was the War of 1812, when the British succeeded in burning Washington, only to be rebuffed by the U.S. forces protecting Baltimore at Fort McHenry.  The second is of course the Civil War, in which Richmond, as capital of the Confederacy, lay so close to Washington that it blocked the way south and created strategic and symbolic challenges for the Union Army of the Potomac.</p>  <p><em>The Capital and the Bay: Narratives of Washington and the Chesapeake Bay Region, ca. 1600-1925</em> comprises 139 books selected from the Library of Congress\\'s General Collections and two books from its Rare Book and Special Collections Division.  The selections were made by Steve McCollum, Jurretta Jordan Heckscher, Christopher Pohlhaus,  and Elizabeth Gettins.  In addition to the constraints of copyright date noted above, three criteria governed the selection of works for the collection: whether the work was a primary source reflecting the character of local or regional history; whether the work was a first-person narrative by an inhabitant of the region; and, finally, whether it relayed a perspective on an event of note through the eyes of a contemporary observer.  These follow closely the criteria used in previous local history collections from American Memory.</p>  <p>As in previous collections, there are regrettable limitations in the range of voices one can hear in this collection.  Most obviously, there is a dearth of works from Native Americans, African Americans, and other racial and ethnic minorities arising from the circumstances of history that severely constrained the number of books published by members of these groups during the time the collection covers.  Certainly there were people in these groups who did publish, however, and within the confines of the selection criteria such works have been included whenever possible.</p>'],\n",

The first product of this collaboration,\\xa0<em>The World of 1898: The Spanish-American War</em>, came online in 1998.\\xa0<em>Puerto Rico at the Dawn of the Modern Age</em>\\xa0now joins it, while also expanding the Library of Congress's continuing commitment to highlight the histories of distinctive American regions through the online presentation of materials selected from a number of divisions.</p> <p><em>Puerto Rico at the Dawn of the Modern Age</em>\\xa0encompasses historically important writings by prominent Puerto Rican political activists and historians dating from approximately seventy years before the Spanish-American war (1831) until some thirty years after it (1929). Texts from the postwar period include the only English-language works in the collection. Among these are soldiers' reminiscences about the conflict and short histories designed to acquaint an American audience with Puerto Rico in the earliest years of its affiliation with the United States.</p> <p>The collection comprises 11 monographs scanned from printed copies and 39 political pamphlets and 2 monographs and a journal scanned from microfilm. The pamphlets are part of the Puerto Rican Memorial Collection, 1846-1907, a collection of 447 pamphlets microfilmed in 1994 that covers agriculture and botany, economics, education, government, politics, history, literature, legal materials, and public health. Reels 13 (addresses, essays, laws, and political parties) and 14 (politics and government) are featured in\\xa0<em>Puerto Rico at the Dawn of the Modern Age</em>. All pamphlets are in Spanish. Four of the books are in English and the rest in Spanish. The materials in the collection were selected by Edmundo Flores, a curator in the Hispanic Division.</p> <p><em>Puerto Rico at the Dawn of the Modern Ag</em>e does not present a socially comprehensive view of Puerto Rican history during the period it covers. The books and pamphlets in this collection were written by educated men of European descent whose perspectives inevitably differed from the viewpoints of those less privileged in Puerto Rican society at the time. Individuals of African descent, and to a lesser extent women, seldom had access to the education or technology that would have enabled them to leave published records of their thoughts, deeds, and daily life.</p>\"],\n",

       "    'description': [\"<p>This collection presents 718 excerpts of sound recordings, 1,256 photographs, and 10 manuscripts from the American Folklife  Center's Coal River Folklife Project Collection. The project documented traditional uses of the mountains in the Big Coal River Valley of southern West Virginia, and explored the cultural dimensions of ecological crisis from 1992 to 1999. There are extensive interviews with local residents on the seasonal harvesting of natural resources--ginseng, ramps (wild leeks), berries, nuts, fish, and game--on occupations, including coal mining and lumbering; and on the impact of large scale industries such as logging and mountaintop removal mining on local communities. Cultural and religious community events were a focus of the project, including storytelling, community dinners and foodways, baptisms, and cemetery customs. </p> <p>Functioning as a de facto commons, the mountains have supported a way of life that for many generations has entailed hunting, gathering, and subsistence gardening, as well as coal mining and lumbering. This commons, articulated through stories, place names, artifacts, and seasonal practices, powerfully evokes collective memory and anchors community life. The commons is situated in what is known as the mixed mesophytic forest, a temperate-zone hardwood system unrivaled for its biological diversity. Consequently it supports an unusually diverse seasonal round of activities. </p> <p>The Coal River Folklife Collection (AFC 1999/008) consists of approximately 290 audio cassettes, 13,647 still photographs, five Hi-8 videocassettes, and 26 linear feet of print material including administrative correspondence, photo and recording logs, tape transcriptions, field notes, maps, publications, and ephemera. All this material, together with a complete project inventory, is available to researchers in the American  Folklife  Center's Folklife Reading Room at the Library of Congress.</p> <p> Mary Hufford, the field project director and curator for the online collection, collaborated with the late science writer John Flynn, of Rock Creek, West   Virginia, and with photographers Lyntha Scott Eiler and Terry Eiler, to create the sound recordings and photographic images comprising the core of the collection. The Coal River Folklife Project was conducted in cooperation with the Lucy Braun Association for the Mixed Mesophytic Forest and Trees for the Planet, with funding from the Lila Wallace Reader's Digest Fund for Folk Culture, and with the support of the Coal River Mountain Watch, based in Whitesville, West Virginia. Support from the National Park Service is gratefully acknowledged for documentation undertaken on the Coal River in 1993 as a part of the American Folklife Center's New River Gorge Folklife Project.</p>\"],\n",

The collection\\'s 138  volumes depict the land and its resources; the conflicts between  settlers and Native peoples; the experience of pioneers and  missionaries, soldiers and immigrants and reformers; the growth of local  communities and local cultural traditions; and the development of  regional and national leadership in agriculture, business, medicine,  politics, religion, law, journalism, education, and the role of women. </p>  <figure class=\"image-align-right\">   <a href=\"/resource/g4060.ct003546/\"><img src=\"/collections/static/pioneering-the-upper-midwest/images/regional-map.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a>   <figcaption><a href=\"/item/2011589605/\">Regional Map</a> (1873)</figcaption>  </figure>  <p>The online books in this digital collection  are made up of the digitized page images and  transcribed, searchable text of some of the books from the Library of  Congress\\'s General  Collections and (in a few cases) its Rare Book and Special Collections  Division.  Each book is also described in a bibliographic record that  links to the searchable text and page images.  Users can look at the  facsimile images of a book\\'s pages to read it just as they would if they  held the real book in their hands; or they can search or browse or read  the book\\'s text in its electronic transcription.</p>  <p>This collection starts from the recognition that digital technology  offers uniquely powerful tools for exploiting the extensive holdings of  regional, state and local history materials in the Library of Congress\\'s  General Collections.   Following a digital collection of <a href=\"http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/cbhtml/cbhome.html\">books on the early history of California</a>, <em>Pioneering the Upper Midwest: Books from Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, ca. 1820-1910</em> becomes the second installment in a virtual local history bookshelf  that will bring some of these riches to students, teachers, scholars,  and lifelong learners throughout the nation.</p>  <p>Although it contains matter enough for in-depth study of the history  of any one of the states it covers, the collection was conceived with a  regional focus.  Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin each have  fascinating individual histories, but they also have so much in common,  both historically and geographically, that looking at them in relation  to each other offers important perspectives on the experience of place,  time and culture in North America.  What sorts of primary sources can  the Library\\'s General Collections offer about the developing identity of  an entire region, one that is both literally and figuratively central  to the story of the nation\\'s past?  That is the question from which this  digital collection grew.</p>  <p>Generous and enthusiastic financial support from the <a href=\"http://www.WKKF.org/\" target=\"_blank\">W. K. Kellogg Foundation <i class=\"icon icon-external-link\"><span>External</span></i></a> was the crucial component that made the collection possible.  From the  beginning, also, the  collection was able to depend on the support of expert resources both  inside and outside the  Library.  Once the Kellogg grant had guaranteed that the idea for the  collection would become a reality, the selection of materials to be  included began in earnest in 1995 under the guidance of the late Judith  Austin, head of the Library\\'s <a href=\"//lcweb.loc.gov/rr/genealogy/\">Local History and Genealogy Reading Room</a>.   Anne Toohey and Barbara Walsh, reference librarians, compiled an  initial list of choices, which was refined and expanded with the expert  advice of Richard Hulsey and Jane Ratner of the Willard Public Library  in Battle Creek, Michigan; Michael Fox and Patrick Coleman of the  Minnesota Historical Society; Ann Regan of  the Minnesota Historical  Society Press; and James Hensen of the Wisconsin Historical Society.   Additional choices were made by Jurretta J. Heckscher, Steve McCollum,  and Elisabeth H. Null, of the National Digital Library Program at the  Library of Congress.</p>  <p>The major principle governing selection was the desire to reflect the  character of local or regional history, generally through first-person  accounts in as broad as possible a range of voices.  Many of the volumes  in the final selection meet this criterion.  Yet it also became clear  that other kinds of documents could also be valuable components of the  digital collection: biographies, certain reference works, early  ethnographic literature, promotional literature designed to entice  settlers and travellers, even a book of cartoons.  These too made their  way into the collection. Finally, though the works included were all  published between the early nineteenth and the early twentieth century,  some were created much earlier.  Around the turn of the twentieth century, all three state historical societies published compilations of  older historical documents about the region\\'s Native and colonial  history.  These offered a superb resource for deepening the collection\\'s  scope in topic and in time, and several volumes from these historical  society serials have been chosen accordingly.</p>  <p>This digital collection has certain limitations, enforced by  historical circumstances and practical  necessities.  A number of choices had to be ruled out because of  copyright considerations.  Only a handful of works published after 1920  could be included, and before 1920 the published record produced by the  region\\'s Native peoples, for example, is very small.  Native Americans  are therefore represented in the collection primarily through white  peoples\\' eyes.  Moreover, while the pre-1920 holdings of Upper  Midwestern materials in the Library\\'s General Collections are extensive,  they cannot be regarded as absolutely comprehensive, and there are some  identifiable gaps.  One might wish, for example, for more books that  reflect the importance of the Lutheran presence in the development of  the region\\'s religious identity, or more works reflecting the Cornish or  Slovenian or Finnish or Croatian immigrant experience.  The physical  condition of some other books prevented their inclusion.  Even under the  best of circumstances, scanning subjects very fragile books to an  unacceptable amount of stress, and it cannot capture the full images of  pages that are very tightly bound.  A few desirable volumes that fell  into these categories had therefore to be excluded. Finally, this  digital collection is a showcase for materials in the General  Collections.  The handful of Rare Book items included is a welcome  bonus, but the shape of the collection should not be taken to represent  the full range of relevant materials held by the Rare Book and Special  Collections Division.</p>'],\n",

Butcher photographs and the letters of the Uriah W. Oblinger family. Together they illustrate the story of settlement on the Great Plains. Approximately 3,000 glass plate negatives crafted by Butcher record the process of settlement in Nebraska between 1886 and 1912. Butcher photographed actively in central Nebraska including Custer, Buffalo, Dawson and Cherry counties. The approximately 3,000 pages of Oblinger family letters discuss land, work, neighbors, crops, religious meetings, problems with grasshoppers, financial problems, and the Easter Blizzard of 1873. Uriah Oblinger came from Indiana to Fillmore County, Nebraska in 1873 to claim a homestead for his family. In the eloquent letters exchanged between Uriah and his wife Mattie, and in letters to other family members, Oblinger expresses very personal insight into the joy, despair, and determination in their struggle to establish a home on the prairie. </p>'],\n",

       "    'description': ['<p>Includes 41 motion pictures and 28 sound recordings, motion pictures produced from 1945 to 1965 by Leslie Stewart (owner of the Ninety-Six Ranch), 2,400 still photographs drawn from the Center\\'s ethnographic field project conducted 1978-1982 and from historic photos dating 1870-1958. Background essays provide historical and cultural context for this distinctive northern Nevada ranching community. <em>Buckaroos in Paradise: Ranching Culture in Northern Nevada, 1945-1982</em> presents documentation of a Nevada cattle-ranching community, with a focus on the family-run Ninety-Six Ranch. The focus was on the work of buckaroos, as cowboys are commonly called in the region. </p> <p>Paradise Valley is the name of both a cattle-ranching valley and a crossroads community in northern Nevada\\'s Humboldt County. It is home to persons of Anglo American, Italian, German, Basque, Swiss, Northern Paiute Indian, and Chinese heritage. The valley is a cul-de-sac formed by the Santa   Rosa Mountains and watered by their melting snows. Miners and agriculturists arrived at about the time of the Civil War, but the mines played out by the end of the century and the valley was devoted to ranching through the 1980s. Ranching has continued even as improved technology has again made the extraction of gold profitable and mining has been revived. </p> <p>The documentation for this online collection was largely drawn from the work of an ethnographic field research project in Paradise  Valley, Nevada conducted by the American Folklife Center from 1978 to 1982. The project documented more than thirty ranches and numerous other sites and activities, resulting in extensive collection of administrative papers, printed materials, and collected ephemera; 45,300 color and black-and photos; 150 hours of sound recorded interviews; four hours of l6mm motion picture film; one hour of historic motion picture footage (copied to video); and 10 hours of video recordings. The Paradise Valley Folklife Project collection (AFC 1991/021) is available to researchers in the Folklife Reading Room. </p> <p>The Paradise Valley Folklife Project employed a team of researchers representing different disciplines who documented a variety of aspects of traditional life. Howard W. \"Rusty\" Marshall, then of the Folklife Center\\'s staff, directed the project. Richard E. Ahlborn documented ranch crafts and horse gear. Marshall and Ahlborn co-authored the publication that accompanied the exhibition (<em>Buckaroos in Paradise</em>. Washington: Library of Congress, 1980. Reprint, Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1981). Thomas Vennum Jr. interviewed Northern Paiute Indians about their work as ranch hands and buckaroos. James Deetz led a group of historical archeologists (Eugene Prince, Lynn Eisenmann, and Jamey Deetz) in a survey of the valley\\'s former Chinese community and two historic archeological sites on the Ninety-Six Ranch. Margaret Sermons Purser continued to research the early history of the community, culminating in her doctoral dissertation \"Community and Material Culture in Nineteenth Century Paradise Valley,  Nevada\" (Ph.D. diss., University of California, 1987) (AFC 1987/047). Carl Fleischhauer \\xa0participated in various roles, notably organizing the project\\'s overall media documentation effort, compiling information about Leslie J. \"Les\" Stewart and his Ninety-Six Ranch, and producing a videodisc about the ranch, now transformed into this online collection. Fleischhauer was joined in producing media documentation by William H. \"Bill\" Smock, a filmmaker from San Francisco, who worked as a still photographer and produced the motion pictures included in this online collection.</p> <p>The project team also included specialist researchers contracted by the Folklife Center. Keith Cunningham documented oral traditions in the town of Paradise Valley. He and his wife, Kathy Cunningham, also prepared a comprehensive index to the field research project\\'s 150 hours of tape recordings. Linda Gastañaga studied the Basque presence. Suzi Jones studied foodways and material culture. William A. \"Bert\" Wilson studied the annual cycle of work on several valley ranches. </p> <p>During 1983-1985, materials were selected from the project collection for a laser videodisc. In its first version, the disc provided an interactive video display in the 1983 Library of Congress exhibition The American Cowboy, and in its final form two years later, it became a publication of the American  Folklife  Center entitled <em>The Ninety-Six: A Cattle Ranch in Northern Nevada</em>. The content and structure of the videodisc forms the basis for this online collection. </p>'],\n",

       "       'description': ['<p>Contains 277 documents relating to the work of Congress and  the drafting and ratification of the Constitution.  Items include  extracts of the journals of Congress, resolutions, proclamations,  committee reports, treaties, and early printed versions of the <a href=\"/resource/bdsdcc.c0801\">United States Constitution</a> and the <a href=\"/resource/bdsdcc.02101\">Declaration of Independence</a>. Most broadsides are one page in length; others range from 1 to 28 pages. A number of  these items contain manuscript annotations not recorded elsewhere that  offer insight into the delicate process of creating consensus. In many  cases, multiple copies bearing manuscript annotations are available to  compare and contrast. </p> <h2>Introduction</h2> <p>The Broadside Collection in the Rare Book Division of the Library of  Congress consists of approximately 40,000 items dating from 1527 to the  present but predominantly featuring 18th- and 19th-century Americana.  Most of the 18th-century items were preserved because of the foresight  of Ebenezer Hazard and Peter Force. Hazard was a historian and collector  of papers relating to the European settlements in North America.    Force, a historian and collector, published <em>American Archives</em>, a  compilation of early American documents from 1774-76.  Force acquired  parts of Hazard\\'s collection to add to his library.  The Library of  Congress purchased the Peter Force Library in 1867, establishing its  first major collections of 18th-century American newspapers, incunabula,  early American imprints, manuscripts, and rare maps and atlases.   Complementing the Continental Congress and Constitutional Convention  Broadside Collections are at least 2,000 additional items dating from  1774 to 1789 that include proceedings and proclamations of state and  local governmental bodies, public notices, petitions, and polemic  essays, as well as proceedings of various British offices relating to  America.</p> <p>This online collection, one of the earliest in American Memory, was  first released in 1995 with bitonal images scanned from microfilm. The  Library of Congress upgraded this collection in 2005 by providing access  to full color scans of the original, for at least one copy of each  broadside. In some cases, duplicate copies bearing manuscript  annotations exist in the collection. The Library scanned these  distinctive copies and is making them accessible as part of the  collection upgrade.</p> <h2>What is a Broadside?</h2> <p> A broadside, or broadsheet, is a large sheet of paper, usually  printed only on one side. This format is often used for rapid  distribution of time-dated ephemeral information and is intended to be  read and shared or thrown away. Especially popular in the 18th-century,  the broadside format was used for a variety of purposes, including  official notices, proclamations, petitions, playbills, news extras, and  advertisements. Broadsides were posted in town halls and coffee houses,  read in churches and public meetings, and often reprinted or excerpted  in local newspapers. </p> <h2>The Continental Congress Broadside Collection </h2> <p>The Continental Congress Broadside Collection, consisting of 256  titles, includes material relating to the work of Congress, dating from  1774 to 1788. Items are predominantly extracts of the journals of  Congress, resolutions, committee reports, proclamations, treaties, and  other congressional proceedings. These broadsides provide a significant  supplement to the <em>Journals of the Continental Congress</em>. Some of  the broadsides trace the evolution of congressional measures at  specific stages of consideration and differ significantly from the  modified resolutions finally adopted by Congress. Some items contain  manuscript annotations not recorded elsewhere that offer insight into  the delicate process of creating consensus. In many cases, multiple  copies bearing manuscript annotations are available to compare and  contrast. Not every major topic considered by Congress is represented by  this collection; the bulk of the material dates from 1781 to 1788. </p> <p>Most of the items in the collection are composed of a single sheet,  meeting the classic definition of a broadside. Some items, however,  range in length to 28 pages. All of these broadsides, many of which were  acquired in 1867 from Peter Force--historian, collector, and compiler  of <em>American Archives</em>--are in the Rare Book and Special  Collections Division, with the exception of one broadside, which is in  the Manuscript Division.</p> <h2>The Constitutional Convention Broadside Collection </h2> <p> The Constitutional Convention Broadside Collection (21 titles) dates  from 1786 to 1789 and includes documents relating to the Constitutional  Convention of 1787, extracts of proceedings of state assemblies and  conventions relating to the ratification of the Constitution, and  several essays on ratification. </p> <p>Most of the items in the collections are composed of a single sheet,  meeting the classic definition of a broadside. Some items, however,  range in length to twenty-eight pages. All of these broadsides, many of  which were acquired in 1867 from Peter Force, are in the <a href=\"//www.loc.gov/rr/rarebook/\">Rare Book and Special Collections Division</a>, with the exception of one broadside, which is in the <a href=\"//www.loc.gov/rr/mss/\">Manuscript Division</a>. </p>'],\n",

       "       'description': ['<p>This online collection is drawn from three primary sources: <em>The War of the Nations: Portfolio in Rotogravure Etchings,</em> a volume published by the <em>New York Times</em> shortly after the armistice that compiled selected images from their \"Mid-Week Pictorial\" supplements of 1914-19; Sunday rotogravure sections from the <em>New York Times </em>for 1914-19; and Sunday rotogravure sections from the <em>New York Tribune </em>for 1916-19.</p> <figure class=\"image-align-left\"><a href=\"/resource/sn78004456/1915-05-23/ed-1/?sp=5\"><img src=\"/collections/static/world-war-i-rotogravures/images/rotohome.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a> <figcaption>A French officer and his British ally at the front read the New York Times.</figcaption> </figure> <p><em>The War of Nations</em> is particularly rich. This volume contains 1,398 rotogravure images with brief descriptive captions, broad organizational headings, and a table of contents; 32 maps that describe military engagements throughout the war; and a 3-page appendix that provides a chronology, statistics, treaty excerpts, and highlights of wartime events.</p> <p>Rotogravure collections were chosen for digitization since few quality originals exist in newspaper format due to paper deterioration. Although microfilm of the<em> New York Times</em> and <em>Tribune</em> is readily available both in the Library\\'s Newspaper &amp; Current Periodical Room and in many libraries across the country, pictorial reproduction on microfilm is so poor as to make them unusable. Rotogravure images in particular are of such poor quality on microfilm that they fail to meet most user needs. Whole sections were digitized to faithfully represent integration of rotogravure pages with the rest of the New<em> York Times</em> and <em>New York Tribune</em> pictorial sections to demonstrate their use as attention getters next to less attractive pages.</p> <p>Scanned images of the<em> New York Times</em> pictorial sections of 1914-19 were taken from a collection of that paper\\'s volumes generously donated by Mrs. Sandra Baden to the Library of Congress\\'s Serial and Government Publications Division. Rotogravure sections of the <em>New York Tribune</em> were taken from the Division\\'s collection of bound volumes for scanning.</p> <p>Multiple copies of <em>The War of the Nations: Portfolio in Rotogravure Etchings</em> are available in the Library of Congress. In 1985 the Library prepared a microfilm edition from an original 1919 print copy of this volume; the printed illustrations reside in the Prints &amp; Photographs Division. A reprint edition dated 1977 is also available in the Library\\'s General Collections. The Serial and Government Publications Division received a donated copy of the 1919 edition from Mr. Daniel Pollen; this copy was used for scanning.</p>  <h2>Background and Scope</h2> <p>During the World War I era (1914-18), leading newspapers took advantage of a new printing process that dramatically altered their ability to reproduce images. Rotogravure printing, which produced richly detailed, high quality illustrations—even on inexpensive newsprint paper—was used to create vivid new pictorial sections. Publishers that could afford to invest in the new technology saw sharp increases both in readership and advertising revenue.</p> <p>The images in this collection track American sentiment about the war in Europe, week by week, before and after the United States became involved. Events of the war are detailed alongside society news and advertisements touting products of the day, creating a pictorial record of both the war effort and life at home. The collection includes an illustrated history of World War I selected from newspaper rotogravure sections that graphically documents the people, places, and events important to the war.</p>  <p>Pictorial sections, once limited to weeklies and periodicals, became part of the daily newspaper in the latter half of the nineteenth century. American newspapers competed for readers using investigative exposes, illustrations, and cartoons. William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer attracted new readers to their papers in the 1890s by using photoengraving to publish news photography.</p> <p>In the early 1900s, a specialized photoengraving process, that is, rotogravure printing, became the latest tool in the circulation wars. Capable of producing quality halftone reproductions of photography and artwork at a high speed, even on inexpensive newsprint paper, rotogravure printing allowed newspapers to bring high quality illustrations to the masses.</p> <p>First used in German newspapers, rotogravure was introduced to the American public by the <em>New York Times</em> in a special pictorial section for Christmas, 1912. Beginning March 29, 1914, the <em>Times</em> became one of six newspapers to regularly publish rotogravure art sections as a separate section of the newspaper, mid-week and on Sundays. In 1942 the rotogravure section became a part of its Sunday magazine. </p>  <p>During World War I (1914-18) rotogravure sections captured the details and intensity of the fighting, introduced technological innovations to a curious and interested American public, and documented the work and play of the home front. These pictorials were important tools for promoting U.S. propaganda and influenced how readers viewed world events. Images from the battlefields and dramatic coverage of casualties from the 1915 sinking of the<em> Lusitania</em> by a German U-boat contributed to the U.S. decision to join the war.</p> <p>The Sunday rotogravure sections of two of the most prominent U.S. newspapers of the day, the <em>New York Times </em> and <em>New York Tribune,</em> highlight the variety and diversity of pictorials. In addition to high quality photographs depicting noted personalities of the day, events during the war, celebrations and memorials, and high fashion and the arts, the sections include advertisements.&nbsp; Rotogravure pictorial sections proved very popular with readers, and more importantly, with advertisers. These sections became the most widely read section of the paper and provided a great opportunity to reach new customers.</p>'],\n",

       "       'description': [\"<h2>Sir Francis Drake</h2> <p>Sir Francis Drake's accomplishments as an explorer and naval strategist were unparalleled. His most notable feat was circumnavigating the earth from 1577-80, the first such voyage since Magellan's in 1522 and the only one up to that time captained by the same man from start to finish. Drake's expeditions to the Caribbean and the Pacific, undertaken during the circumnavigation and in subsequent voyages, revealed significant new geographical data about the New World and added greatly to Queen Elizabeth I's [1533-1603] treasury.</p>  <h2>The Collector</h2> <p>Assembled by Hans Peter Kraus and his wife Hanni in only twelve years, these materials reveal a great breadth and scope in the primary and secondary materials that concern Sir Francis Drake. Kraus was one of the foremost booksellers of the second half of the twentieth century. Born in Austria in 1907, he exhibited a precocious mind and a love of collecting from an early age—which soon turned to a love of collecting books. He became a bookseller under the traditional antiquarian Austrian guild system—first becoming an apprentice. In 1939, during the Nazi Occupation, Kraus and his family fled Austria for the United States. Within two weeks of his arrival in New York, Kraus met Hanni, his future wife and business partner. The couple established an antiquarian bookselling firm, H. P. Kraus, Inc., and amassed the stock and the connections needed for success. Their legendary firm opened in the early 1940s and did not close until 2003. The firm collected and sold many first rate editions.</p> <h2>The Collection</h2>  <p>In a 1968 James Ford Bell Lecture, Kraus explained how a chance comment about the enormous profit reaped by Sir Francis Drake and Queen Elizabeth from the around-the-world voyage piqued his interest and led him to study Drake's life. The more that Kraus learned, the more fascinated he became, and he resolved to put together a collection of contemporary materials related to Drake and his journeys. In 1980 Hans and Hanni Kraus generously donated their collection to the Rare Book and Special Collections Division of the Library of Congress. The combination of the Library's other rich collections from this period and the resources of the neighboring Folger Shakespeare Library make Washington a preeminent center for the study of the Elizabethan era.  The Kraus Collection consists of 60 items--16 manuscripts, 29 books, 8 maps and views, and 7 medals and portraits. The materials range in date from 1579 to 1765 and are written in English, Spanish, Latin, Italian, German, French, and Dutch.</p> <h3>Manuscripts</h3>  <p>Manuscripts range in date from 1579 to 1603. They are mostly correspondence between various governing officials and diplomats of the Spanish and English crowns regarding Drake's activities in Spanish America and are written in Spanish, English, Latin, and Italian.

Although many of the authors represented  in <em>American Notes</em> are not widely known, the collection includes works by major figures such as  Matthew Arnold, Fredrika Bremer, William Cullen Bryant, François-René de Chateaubriand, William  Cobbett, James Fenimore Cooper, J. Hector St. John de Crèvecoeur, Charles Dickens, Washington  Irving, Benjamin Henry Latrobe, Sir Charles Lyell, William Lyon Mackenzie, André Michaux,  Thomas Nuttall, Frederick Law Olmsted, and Robert Louis Stevenson.  The narratives in <em>American Notes</em> therefore range from the  unjustly neglected to the justly famous, and from classics of the genre to undiscovered gems.   Together, they build a mosaic portrait of a young nation. </p>  <p><em>American Notes </em> is the fifth in a series of local history collections presented as part of the Library of Congress\\'s American Memory program, joining <a href=\"//memory.loc.gov/ammem/cbhtml/cbhome.html\"><em>\"California As I Saw It</em></a><em>,\"</em> <em><a href=\"/collections/pioneering-the-upper-midwest/about-this-collection/\">Pioneering the Upper Midwest</a>,</em> <em><a href=\"/collections/puerto-rico-books-and-pamphlets/about-this-collection/\">Puerto Rico at the Dawn of the Modern Age</a></em>,  and <a href=\"/collections/washington-and-chesapeake-bay-narratives/about-this-collection/\"><em>The Capital and The Bay</em></a>. Together, these online collections make up a virtual local history bookshelf in intellectually and electronically accessible form.</p>  <p>Three criteria  determined selection: in order to be included, a work had to be written primarily in the first person, free of copyright restrictions,  and part of the Library\\'s General Collections. These criteria follow closely those used in previous local history collections from American  Memory.</p>  <p>As in previous collections, there are regrettable limitations in the range of voices represented in <em>American Notes</em>.  Most obviously, there is a dearth of works from Native Americans, African Americans, and  other racial and ethnic minorities arising from the circumstances of history that severely constrained the number of books  published by members of these groups during the time that the collection covers. Certainly there were people in these groups who  published, and within the confines of the selection criteria, such works are included when possible.</p>'],\n",

       "       'description': ['<p>Work, school, and leisure activities in the United States from 1894 to 1915 are featured in this presentation of 150 motion pictures. Highlights include films of the United States Postal Service from 1903, cattle breeding, fire fighters, ice manufacturing, logging, calisthenic and gymnastic exercises in schools, amusement parks, boxing, expositions, football, parades, swimming, and other sporting events.</p> <p><em>America at Work, America at Leisure: Motion Pictures from 1894-1915</em> consists of 150 motion pictures, 62 of which also appear in other online collections. The majority of the films are from the Paper Print Collection, while the remainder are from the George Kleine Collection, both residing in the Motion Picture, Broadcasting and Recorded Sound Division (M/B/RS) of the Library of Congress. Both of these collections have printed catalogs available in the Motion Picture and Television Reading Room at the Library. The films were selected from these two collections on the basis of the activities pictured in the films and the quality of the available prints. As many different types of work, school, and leisure activities as could be found were sought in order to show the broadest possible representation of activities at the turn of the century. The selection is limited, however, by what is available from these collections; not every possible occupation or leisure activity from the turn of the century is represented. </p> <p>The films in the Paper Print Collection were deposited for copyright from 1894 to 1912 as positive pictures on paper. Many were deposited in this manner on paper rolls frame by frame. For preservation and access purposes, the Library of Congress has made 16mm prints of these Paper Print titles, and has more recently been making 35mm prints of selected titles. For this presentation, 35mm and 16mm prints have been used as the original source material for digitization. Many of the 35mm prints have been produced especially for this Web presentation. </p> <p>The George Kleine Collection consists of films obtained by film distributor and producer George Kleine. The collection includes films produced from 1898 to 1926, representing films by the Edison Company, French and Italian imports, and those produced by Kleine. The collection contains both 35mm and 16mm prints. </p> <p>Links to films in other online collections, such as <em>Inside an American Factory: The Westinghouse Works, 1904</em>;<em> The Last Days of a President: McKinley and the Pan-American Exposition</em>; and <em>Inventing Entertainment: The Early Motion Pictures and Sound Recordings of the Edison Companies</em> are also in the presentation to add further diversity to the films listed. </p> <p>The online collection offers films available in MPEG, QuickTime, and MP4. In the case of the first two formats, films are segmented when longer than four minutes so that file sizes will not be prohibitively large to download.</p>'],\n",

There are more than 28,000 items in the collection with 10,172 available online. The material dates  from the seventeenth century to the present day and covers innumerable  topics.</p>  <p>The library of Peter Force, acquired by the Library of Congress in 1867,  furnished the basis of the Printed Ephemera Collection. Force himself had  secured many of the pieces assembled by an earlier American historian and  collector, Ebenezer Hazard. The majority of the items in the collection were  produced in America and their major strength is in historical Americana. In  adding to the collection, the Library\\'s aim was to accumulate a record of all  broadsides printed in America, and to do so, photostats as well as originals  were collected.</p>  <p><em> Printed  Ephemera: Three Centuries of Broadsides and Other Printed Ephemera</em> delivers online access to the Printed Ephemera Collection,  providing digital images and searchable  text. </p>  <h3>The Nature of Ephemera</h3>  <p>As the name would suggest, printed ephemera tends to be transitory documents  created for a specific purpose, and intended to be thrown away. <em>The Printed  Ephemera Collection</em> at the Library of Congress comprises primary sources  relating to the key events of American history, including the Revolutionary War,  slavery, the Western land rush, the Civil War, women\\'s suffrage, and the  Industrial Revolution. The printed material was produced as the events unfolded  and offers unique snapshots of the nation\\'s past.</p>  <p>Printed ephemera has had multiple purposes, as instanced by the variety of  material assembled in the online collection<em>.</em> A primary purpose was the  distribution of information. In the days before television and radio, citizens  received news by way of broadsides and printed ephemera. For example, <a href=\"/item/94207357/\">a  Baltimore broadside</a> of 1776 gives the first published account of Washington  crossing the Delaware. </p>  <p>Other material tells a different story. Many of the items were never meant to  be kept. For example, an <a href=\"/item/rbpe.02803100/\">ordinary  paint advertisement</a> may not seem of historical interest except for the date:  1792. The list of colors (more than one might expect) gives clues about the  shades and hues that adorned the homes of the nation\\'s founders. A 1928 <a href=\"/item/rbpe.01806000/\">railroad  leaflet</a> includes one of the earliest references to air travel, and shows the  industry in a nascent, and interesting, state. </p>  <p>Printed ephemera also shows a new side of well-known issues and people. A <a href=\"/item/rbpe.0180070a/\">business  card</a> which appears to have been printed by Abraham Lincoln was actually  published and distributed by his opposition in the 1864 presidential election.  It promised that, after losing the election, he\\'d return to Illinois to split  rails and trade horses. </p>  <p>Historical events are brought to life by printed ephemera. In the wake of the  San Francisco earthquake and fire of 1906, Mayor E. E. Schmitz had no choice but  to muster a special police force to keep peace amid the chaos. He empowered the  officers to take extreme measures if necessary, and a <a href=\"/item/rbpe.00202500/\">broadside</a> announced the order. </p>  <p>Lastly, certain items provide a connection with the past in ways that  textbooks cannot. An 1840 poster for <a href=\"/item/rbpe.01602900/\">a  lost dog</a>, printed in Alton, Illinois, shows that people felt as strongly  about their pets in the nineteenth century as today. It also may spark a new consciousness  of one\\'s surroundings: the photocopied sign at the bus stop showing maps and routes  might be insignificant now, but it holds a story that may help to illuminate  history in generations to come. </p>  <p>In exploring the contents of <em>Printed Ephemera</em>, readers may  encounter attitudes and language that are jarring to contemporary sensibilities.  It should be noted that broadsides and printed ephemera express the language,  experience, and viewpoints of the era in which they were published.</p>  <h3>The Printed Ephemera Collection: In the Library\\'s Reading Room and Online</h3>  <p>The majority of the Printed Ephemera Collection at the Library is arranged by  state of imprint. The states are ordered alphabetically, and within each state,  the items are arranged chronologically. The sequence of American material is  followed by international imprints ordered by country, and special classes of  material grouped under a common subject, such as the Continental Congress and  Constitutional Convention broadsides, Lincoln material, and playbills. </p>  <p>The collection is housed in archival folders and placed in flat boxes and map  cases. Readers visiting the Library may use the card file or the published  catalog and make their requests at the front desk of the Rare Book and Special Collections Reading Room.</p>  <p>Users may browse or search keywords in the collection, make selections, and  download the images. Each item included in the online collection has been  digitized in a manner that captures all data on the item. Duplicate copies have  usually not been digitized, nor have surfaces of items that are blank or only  contain Library of Congress information that is reproduced in the bibliographic  description. </p>  <p>Often materials of this sort were produced in such a way that more than one  page of text was printed on one side of a sheet. These sheets were then folded  before distribution so the different pages of text followed each other in  appropriate order. These multiple formats are described in the section <a href=\"/collections/broadsides-and-other-printed-ephemera/articles-and-essays/page-order-and-folding-diagrams/\">Page Order and Folding  Diagrams</a>. The multiple printing formats and folding patterns represented in  the <em>Printed Ephemera</em> are described in the section Page Order and  Folding Diagrams. Original items in these various formats have been digitized  page by page in the order depicted in the applicable Page Order Diagram. </p>  <h3>The Printed Ephemera Collection: Bibliographic Access</h3>  <p>The majority of the <em>Printed Ephemera Collection</em> at the Library has brief  item-level descriptions. Occasionally a group of similar items is covered by a  single record. Some material has had complete cataloging and is described by  MARC records that reside in the Library\\'s online catalog; this comprises only a  small percentage of the collection, however. </p>  <p>Because printed ephemera lacks the uniformity of books, the traditional rules  of cataloging books and other monographs often do not apply. After all,  broadsides don\\'t have title pages. This may explain the simple, and at times  irregular, rendering of the titles in the bibliographic descriptions. For the  most part, these descriptions are not part of the Library\\'s official catalog,  but they remain an invaluable resource. </p>  <p>The collection is shelved in a geographical order, but the card file  maintains cross-referenced access in a total of three ways: geographical,  author/title, and chronological. All three were published in a four-volume set  entitled <em><a href=\"https://lccn.loc.gov/72006563\">Broadsides in the Rare Book Division, Library of Congress</a></em> (Boston: G.K. Hall, 1972), edited by Frederick Goff. </p>  <p><em>The Printed Ephemera Collection,</em> in addition to making printed ephemera  available online, will greatly enhance users\\' access to the collection by  offering keyword searchability, unlocking substantially increased research  potential.  The potential expands even farther with the full textual  transcriptions that are included. These \"full-text\" searches locate occurrences  anywhere in the entire document. </p>  <h3>The Printed Ephemera Collection: In Print and Online</h3>  <p>All information on the catalog cards has been transcribed in the  digital records. Even the backs of the cards, which are not visible in the  published finding aid, are accounted for in the bibliographical records that  accompany the images in this collection.</p>'],\n",

The digitization   of the collection was made possible by a major gift from the Citigroup Foundation. </p> <p>The African American Pamphlet Collection was accessioned in 1990-91 from a miscellaneous pamphlet collection in the <a href=\"//lcweb.loc.gov/rr/rarebook/\">Rare Book and Special Collections Division</a>.   The pamphlets were published from 1824 through 1909.  Most were  written by African-American authors, though some were written by others  on topics of particular importance in African-American history.  The  pamphlets were published in many formats using a wide variety of papers,  typefaces, and printing methods.  Many contain more than one gathering  (grouping of leaves or sheets) and have color covers with ornamental  borders or frames.  A small number include illustrations or other  graphics, such as bar graphs.  The physical size of the pamphlets ranges  from 15 to 26 centimeters.  The entire collection comprises  approximately eleven thousand pages and is housed in thirty-two boxes  labeled A-W.  Within the boxes, the pamphlets are stored in mylar  sleeves labeled with the collection name and the item identification  number. </p> <p>Seventeen of the collection\\'s titles, and many of its authors, can also be found in <a href=\"/collections/daniel-a-p-murray-pamphlets-from-1818-to-1907/\"><em>African American Perspectives: Pamphlets from the Daniel A. P. Murray Collection, 1818-1907</em></a>.  Like the Murray Pamphlet Collection, the African American Pamphlet  Collection presents a panoramic and eclectic overview of many aspects of  African-American history and culture.  The collection includes  first-person accounts of slavery, tracts from anti-slavery  organizations, legislative and presidential campaign materials,  investigative reports, sermons, commencement addresses, organizational  proceedings, and previously published materials from newspapers and  magazines.  Among the noted authors represented are Frederick Douglass,  Lydia Maria Child, Alexander Crummell, Kelly Miller, Charles Sumner,  Mary Church Terrell, and Booker T. Washington. </p> <p>The African American Pamphlet Collection was selected for  digitization because of the historical significance and rarity of its  contents, as well as its complementary value to other American Memory  collections, most notably <em>African American Perspectives</em>. </p> <p>In exploring the contents of <em>From Slavery to Freedom</em>,  readers may encounter attitudes and language that are jarring to  contemporary sensibilities. It should be noted that these materials  express the language, experience, and viewpoints of the era in which  they were written. </p>'],\n",

       "       'description': ['<p>A panoramic and eclectic review of African-American history  and culture, spanning almost one hundred years from the early nineteenth through the early twentieth  centuries, with the bulk of the material published between 1875 and  1900.  Among the authors represented are Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington, Ida B. Wells-Barnett,  Benjamin W. Arnett, Alexander Crummel, and Emanuel Love.</p> <h2>Introduction</h2> <p>The 351 titles in the collection include sermons on racial pride and  political activism; annual reports of charitable, educational, and  political organizations; and college catalogs and graduation orations  from the Hampton Institute, Morgan College, and Wilberforce University.   Also included are biographies, slave narratives, speeches by members of  Congress, legal documents, poetry, playbills, dramas, and librettos.   Other pamphlets focus on segregation, voting rights, violence against  African-Americans, and the colonization of Africa by freed slaves.   Several of the pamphlets are illustrated with portraits of the authors.</p> <p>Researcher LaVerle B. Berry (Library of Congress Federal Research  Division) compiled the annotations for the pamphlets included in the  catalog for the collection.  Berry noted three recurring themes that  present themselves throughout the Murray pamphlets. </p> <p>The first of these themes involves the desire to \"uplift\" the  black race in the United States and to \"improve\" the status of African  Americans.  This concern is almost always described in terms of the  attainment of social, cultural, and material achievements in order to  gain the respect of and equality with whites. </p> <p>A second theme is encompassed by the struggle for civil rights  and equality in the South.  This is most often embodied as an appeal to  the federal government to defend the constitutional rights of African  Americans and protect them from lynchings, executions without trials,  and other violence at the hands of southern mobs.  At the same time, the  necessity for blacks to obey the law is constantly affirmed. </p> <p>The third theme questions the future of freed American slaves --  should they remain in the U.S. as freedmen or emigrate to the colony of  Liberia in Africa?  Several pamphlets mention the American Colonization  Society and other such groups who supported the repatriation of freed  slaves to Africa in an effort to establish and nourish the new colony.</p> <p>Berry further observed a broad range of opinions expressed in the  pamphlets and the tensions between them. Concerning race relations, the  pamphlets reveal strong notes of discord between accommodationist points  of view and the supporters of a more militant stance.  Most pamphlets  lean more toward the former than the latter, although there are several  militant writers to be found among them. </p> <p>Also, pamphleteers focus primarily upon the problems of southern  African Americans rather than those in the North.  While northern blacks  are not ignored and the problems facing African Americans are more  often discussed in national terms, the overriding concern lies with the  attitudes of southern whites toward southern blacks.</p> <h2>Collection History</h2> <p id=\"murray\" name=\"murray\">Daniel A. P. Murray (1852-1925), an employee of the Library of Congress from 1871 to 1923,  was charged with the task of gathering books and pamphlets for the  Exhibit of Negro Authors at the 1900 Paris Exposition.  The volumes he  collected formed the nucleus of the Library\\'s Collection of Books by  Colored Authors.</p> <p>In 1926 the Library received a bequest of 1,448 books and pamphlets  that Murray had privately assembled.  These volumes were added to the  Colored Authors\\' Collection and were later integrated with the general  collections of the Library, with many duplicates being transferred to  Howard University.  Twenty-two volumes of bound pamphlets were  transferred to the Rare Books and Special Collections Division; these  volumes form the current Daniel A. P. Murray Pamphlet Collection.</p> <p>The volumes in the collection are labeled A to G and 12 to 28; it has  been assumed that volumes A to 28 represented a continuous set, with  the enumeration changing from numbers to letters.  An inventory dated  January 9, 1974, showed that the volumes that fall between G and 12, as  well as volume 27, are missing.  The arrangement of the pamphlets within  the volumes is not based on chronology or subject; although often a  number of works by the same author may appear in a single volume, the  arrangement is apparently little more than random.</p> <p>In 1990 the Daniel A. P. Murray Pamphlet Collection underwent phased  conservation treatment.  The volumes were disbound; the pages were  deacidified and buffered, mended and guarded; and, where needed, the  individual pages of each pamphlet were encapsulated.  The individual  pamphlets are now stored in acid-free boxes, the order of which  corresponds to that of the original volumes. </p> <p>There are now 386 pieces in the collection; all except the thirty-five duplicate titles have been digitized.</p> <h2>Daniel A. P. Murray</h2> <figure class=\"image-align-right\">  <img src=\"/collections/static/daniel-a-p-murray-pamphlets-from-1818-to-1907/images/photo03.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" />  <figcaption><em>Daniel A. P. Murray (1852 -1925).  Photographer unknown.  Photograph, undated.</em></figcaption> </figure> <p>Daniel Alexander Payne Murray (1852-1925) was born in Baltimore,  Maryland, the son of a freed slave.  At the age of nine, he moved to  Washington, D.C. to work for his brother, a caterer and manager of the  United States Senate Restaurant.  Ten years later, in 1871, Murray  became a member of the twelve-person staff of the Library of Congress as  the personal assistant to the Librarian of Congress, Ainsworth Rand  Spofford.  Murray was the second African-American to hold a professional  position at the Library of Congress.  In 1881, he was promoted to  assistant librarian.</p> <p>In 1899, Spofford\\'s successor, Herbert Putnam, asked Murray to  compile a collection of books and pamphlets by black authors for an  exhibition of \"Negro Authors\" at the 1900 Paris Exposition.  Murray  published a preliminary list of titles in 1900, appealing to the public  for donations of listed works, as well as suggested additions.  Within  several months, his list had grown to eleven hundred titles; his  collection became the core of the Library of Congress\\'s \"Colored  Authors\\' Collection.\"  Although Murray planned to expand his collection  and create an encyclopedia of African-American achievement, the project  never received sufficient support to become a reality.</p> <p>Murray was widely acknowledged as an authority on African-American  concerns.  He was the first African-American member of the Washington  Board of Trade, and he testified before the House of Representatives  about Jim Crow laws and the migration of African-Americans from rural  locations to urban areas.  He was twice a delegate to the Republican  National Convention and was a member of many other councils and  organizations.  He was also a prolific author, and a frequent  contributor to African-American journals, in particular <em>The Voice of the Negro.</em> Murray\\'s personal library of African-American works was bequeathed to the Library of Congress upon his death in 1925.</p>'],\n",

       "       'description': ['<p>The recordings of former slaves in <em>Voices from the Days of Slavery: Former Slaves Tell Their Stories</em> come from several collections held in the American Folklife Center\\'s archive. The almost seven hours of recorded interviews presented here took place between 1932 and 1975 in nine states. Twenty-three interviewees discuss how they felt about slavery, slaveholders, coercion of slaves, their families, and freedom. Several individuals sing songs, many of which were learned during the time of their enslavement. It is important to note that all of the interviewees spoke sixty or more years after the end of their enslavement, and it is their full lives that are reflected in these recordings. The individuals documented in this presentation have much to say about living as African Americans from the 1870s to the 1930s, and beyond. </p>  <p>All known recordings of former slaves in the American Folklife Center are included in this presentation. Some are being made publicly available for the first time. Unfortunately, not all the recordings are clearly audible. Although the original tapes and discs are generally in good physical condition, background noise and poorly positioned microphones make it extremely difficult to follow many of the interviews. It is important to note, that an additional 2300 non-audio interviews with ex-slaves are available online:<a href=\"https://memory.loc.gov/ammem/snhtml/snhome.html\"><em> Born in Slavery: Slave Narratives from the Federal Writers\\' Project, 1936-1938</em></a>. The contextual and interpretive material accompanying those interviews are often equally useful for understanding the recordings in this presentation.</p>  <p>Three of the recordings presented here were made for the Commonwealth of Virginia between 1937 and 1940 by Roscoe E. Lewis in affiliation with the Federal Writers\\' Project (FWP) of the Works Progress Administration (WPA). Another ten recordings are part of a 1300-disc collection donated to the Library by the American Dialect Society in 1984. Five of these interviews were recorded by Lorenzo Dow Turner in 1932 and 1933 in the Gullah areas of South Carolina and Georgia. The remainder were recorded by Archibald A. Hill and Guy S. Lowman in Virginia from 1934 to 1935.The remaining thirteen recordings were made by a number of different fieldworkers. The earliest came from a 1935 recording expedition to Georgia, Florida, and the Bahamas by Alan Lomax, Zora Neale Hurston, and Mary Elizabeth Barnicle. Their goal was to collect stories and music from African Americans in these areas. In 1940, John A. Lomax, who had recently been appointed honorary curator of the Library of Congress\\'s Archive of Folk Song, and his wife Ruby T. Lomax conducted interviews in Texas. These were followed by recordings made in 1941 by Robert Sonkin (in Alabama), and by John H. Faulk (in Texas) with support from a Rosenwald scholarship and the Library of Congress. In 1941, as part of a joint venture between the Library of Congress and Fisk University, Charles S. Johnson, Lewis W. Jones, John W. Work, and Alan and Elizabeth Lomax conducted interviews in Mississippi. Hermond Norwood, a Library of Congress engineer at the time, recorded an interview in 1949 in Maryland. The most recent interviews were conducted by Elmer E. Sparks in 1974 (in Texas) and 1975 (in Florida).</p>  <p>Efforts were made to collect biographical information about the interviewees and interviewers. Unfortunately, with few exceptions, only a small amount of information was found about the former slaves. A book and numerous newspaper and magazine articles were written about Charlie Smith, who lived to be 137. Fountain Hughes was interviewed by the Towson, Maryland, Jeffersonian in 1952 when he was 101. Transcripts of WPA interviews with <a href=\"https://dev.loc.gov/resource/mesn.143/seq-275\">Samuel Polite</a> and <a href=\"https://dev.loc.gov/resource/mesn.144/seq-198\">Dave White</a> and with <a href=\"https://dev.loc.gov/resource/mesn.163/seq-45\">Billy McCrea\\'s</a> brother are available, as are photographs and field notes related to several former slaves. However, for most of the ex-slaves, it is their interviews that provide the most complete information about them. More information is available about the people who conducted the interviews; summaries are found in <a href=\"https://dev.loc.gov/collections/stories-from-former-slaves/articles-and-essays/biographies-of-the-interviewers/\">Biographies  of the Interviewers</a>.</p>  <p>The recordings in this online collection provide an opportunity for linguists to examine the development of Black English and the transformation of language over time. Transcriptions of recordings received from the American Dialect Society are available for the first time in this presentation as are transcriptions of several other previously published interviews, including those made for the book <em>The Emergence of Black English: Text and Commentary</em>, edited by Guy Bailey, Natalie Maynor, and Patricia Cukor-Avila (Philadelphia: John Benjamins Publishing Co., 1991) and appear with slight modifications in this presentation. American Folklife Center staff transcribed the remaining recordings. The transcripts, for the most part, are presented in standard English; however, as the audio tracks attest, the speakers all render their stories in a variety of dialects that reflect their heritage. Recordings that suffer from poor audio quality have gaps in their transcriptions, but even in those cases, the transcriptions are a useful tool for following and understanding the interviews.</p>  <p>Twenty-eight songs (or song fragments) are included in the recordings. Many of the songs are difficult to identify because folk melodies and lyrics tend to change over time.<br>  </p>'],\n",

Initially, only four states involved    in the project (Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and Virginia) focused on collecting    the stories of people who had once been held in slavery. John A. Lomax, the    National Advisor on Folklore and Folkways for the FWP (and the curator of the    Archive of American Folk Song at the Library of Congress), was extremely interested    in the ex-slave material he received from these states. In 1937 he directed    the remaining states involved in the project to carry out interviews with former    slaves as well. Federal field workers were given instructions on what kinds    of questions to ask their informants and how to capture their dialects, the  result of which may sometimes be offensive to today\\'s readers (see <a href=\"/collections/slave-narratives-from-the-federal-writers-project-1936-to-1938/articles-and-essays/note-on-the-language-of-the-narratives/\">A Note on the Language of  the Narratives</a>).  The field workers    often visited the people they interviewed twice in order to gather as many recollections    as possible. Sometimes they took photographs of informants and their houses.    The interviewers then turned the narratives over to their state\\'s FWP director for    editing and eventual transfer to Washington, D.C. The <a href=\"/item/mesn001/\">administrative files</a> accompanying the narratives detail the information supplied to field  workers as well as subjects of concern to state directors of the FWP.  For more information about the interviewers, the people interviewed, and  the processes of collection and compilation, see <a href=\"/collections/slave-narratives-from-the-federal-writers-project-1936-to-1938/articles-and-essays/introduction-to-the-wpa-slave-narratives/\">Norman Yetman\\'s essay</a> which accompanies this online collection.</p>  <p>In 1939, the FWP lost its funding, and the states were ordered to send whatever    manuscripts they had collected to Washington. Once most of the materials had arrived at the Library of Congress, Benjamin A. Botkin, the folklore editor    of the FWP who later became head of the Archive of Folk Culture at the Library of Congress, undertook the remaining editing and indexing of the narratives and selected the photographs for inclusion. As noted above, he organized the    narratives by state, and then alphabetically by name of informant within each state, collecting them in 1941 into seventeen bound volumes in thirty-three parts under the title <em>Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the    United States from Interviews with Former Slaves</em> (Washington,  D.C., 1941).    The multivolume set and other project files, including some earlier unbound  annotated versions of the narratives, are housed in the  Manuscript Division and described in the  <a href=\"http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/eadmss.ms009053\">finding aid</a> for the records of the WPA.</p>  <p>Other records relating  to the ex-slave project are among the FWP files at the National  Archives and Records Administration (Record Group 69.5.5) and are  described in the <em>Guide to Federal Records in the National Archives of the United States, Vol. I</em>. (Washington, D.C.: National Archives and Records Administration, 1995).    Volumes 2-17 of <em>The American Slave: A Composite Autobiography</em>, edited by George P. Rawick and others (Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 1972-79), present these narratives with a slightly different organization; the later    volumes of Rawick\\'s series also include ex-slave interviews housed in other archives. Anthologies containing selections from the Library of Congress collection include the Federal Writers\\' Project\\'s <em>Lay My Burden Down: A Folk History    of Slavery</em>, edited by B. A. Botkin (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1945) and <em>Voices from Slavery</em> (New York:    Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1970), edited by Norman R. Yetman, author of  <a href=\"/collections/slave-narratives-from-the-federal-writers-project-1936-to-1938/articles-and-essays/introduction-to-the-wpa-slave-narratives/\">An Introduction to the WPA Slave Narratives</a> under the Articles and Essays tab.

It includes the complete collection of  Stern\\'s  contemporary newspapers, Lincoln\\'s law papers, sheet music, broadsides,   prints, cartoons, maps, drawings, letters, campaign tickets, and other   ephemeral items. The books and pamphlets in this collection are  scheduled for  digitization at a later date.</p>  <p>Alfred Whital Stern (1881-1960) of Chicago presented his  outstanding  collection of Lincolniana to the Library of Congress in 1953. Stern   began collecting in the 1920s. His collection documents the life of  Abraham  Lincoln (1809-1865) both through writings by and about Lincoln  as well as a  large body of publications concerning the issues of the  times including  slavery, the Civil War, Reconstruction, and related  topics. </p>  <p>Highlights of the online collection include Lincoln\\'s own   scrapbook of the 1858 political campaign against Stephen A. Douglas; the  Tiffany  seed pearl necklace and bracelets that Lincoln gave to his  wife, Mary Todd; a  Lincoln life mask cast in bronze by Clark Mills, as  well as the contents of  Lincoln\\'s pockets on the evening of his  assassination. Probably the single most  famous Lincoln manuscript in  the collection is the January 26, 1863, letter to  General Joseph  Hooker, placing him in command of the Army of the Potomac. </p>  <p>Alfred Whital Stern\\'s gift to the Library represents the   most extensive collection of Lincolniana ever assembled by a private   individual. </p>  <p>Below is a listing of the types of items  in the Alfred Whital Stern Collection of Lincolniana.</p>  <table class=\"table-bordered table-padded\">   <tr>    <th scope=\"col\">Types of Items in the     Collection</th>    <th scope=\"col\">Number of Items</th>   </tr>   <tr>    <td>Advertisements </td>    <td>302 </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td>Books </td>    <td>\\xa0 5 </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td>Broadsides </td>    <td>515 </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td>Correspondence </td>    <td>81 </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td>Ephemera </td>    <td>206 </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td>Government publications </td>    <td>33 </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td>Humor, satire </td>    <td>76 </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td>Legal cases and case notes </td>    <td>224 </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td>Letters </td>    <td>81 </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td>Manuscripts </td>    <td>298 </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td>Maps </td>    <td>\\xa0\\xa0 9 </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td>Newspapers </td>    <td>296 </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td>Pamphlets </td>    <td>\\xa0 9 </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td>Periodicals </td>    <td>290 </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td>Photographs </td>    <td>69 </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td>Poetry </td>    <td>57 </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td>Portraits </td>    <td>336 </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td>Postcards </td>    <td>\\xa0 9 </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td>Realia </td>    <td>24 </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td>Sheet music </td>    <td>249 </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td>Speeches </td>    <td>27 </td>   </tr>  </table>'],\n",

       "       'description': ['<p> Consisting of 104 motion pictures and four sound recordings, the majority of the motion pictures (87) are from the Theodore Roosevelt Association Collection in the Motion Picture, Broadcasting and Recorded Sound Division (M/B/RS) at the Library of Congress.</p> <p>Founded in 1919, the Theodore Roosevelt Association was organized to perpetuate the legacy of Theodore Roosevelt. As part of its mission, it amassed a collection of motion pictures relating to the life and times of the former president. The collection contained films of persons and events from the period in which he lived, as well as films which featured Roosevelt. Much of the footage was taken from newsreels and other actuality films of the time. The association also compiled some of this footage to make silent documentaries on various aspects of Roosevelt\\'s life, such as his trip on the River of Doubt in Brazil or the building of the Roosevelt Dam.</p> <p>In 1962, the Association gave its film collection of 381 titles to the Library of Congress, where it currently resides. A catalog for the entire collection which gave detailed information for each film was compiled in 1986 by Wendy White-Hensen and Veronica M. Gillespie. The collection as a whole serves as an important representation of the latter part of Roosevelt\\'s life before the motion picture cameras and of political and world events of the first two decades of the twentieth century. (More detailed information about this collection is available in the essay by Veronica M. Gillespie entitled T. R. on Film.)</p> <p>For the online presentation, a selection of eighty-seven films from the collection was chosen, based on the quality of the footage and the events pictured. There are numerous films in the collection with different versions, essentially the same with only slight differences in editing. In such cases, the copy determined to be the best and most complete was digitized for the online presentation. Films were also chosen to represent as many different times and phases of Roosevelt\\'s life and career as possible.</p> <p>The Theodore Roosevelt Association Collection is predominantly composed of footage made after his presidency. To amplify the few films in this collection that were made during his presidency, seventeen films from the <a href=\"/collections/films-of-westinghouse-works-1904/articles-and-essays/\">Paper Print Film Collection</a> in M/B/RS were added to the presentation. These films show Roosevelt in various public appearances which he made as president. Other films from the Paper Print Collection show Roosevelt in events relating to the Spanish-American War before he was elected president.</p> <p>The online presentation, then, contains films of Roosevelt from 1898 to 1919, and some films composed after his death, from 1919 until approximately 1928. The films are available in MPEG, Quick Time, and MP4 formats, and in the case of the first two formats, are segmented when longer than four minutes so that file sizes will not be prohibitively large to download. (More information about the procedure used to digitize the collection is available in Building the Digital Collection.)</p> <p>The following films appear in this presentation with the kind permission of the Theodore Roosevelt Association, which produced them:</p> <ul>  <li>The Story of the Panama Canal [1]</li>  <li>T. R.\\'s Return from Africa, 1910 [2]</li>  <li>A Visit to Theodore Roosevelt at His Home at Sagamore Hill, Oyster Bay, L.I., 1912</li>  <li>Roosevelt, Friend of the Birds [1]</li>  <li>The Roosevelt Dam [1]</li>  <li>The River of Doubt [2].</li> </ul> <p>Permission may be needed from the association before using these films for other purposes. Contact the Theodore Roosevelt Association, P.O. Box 719, Oyster Bay, N.Y. 11771 by mail or by email at tra@sprynet.com.</p> <p>The four sound recordings selected for this presentation were made by Roosevelt for the Edison Company in 1912. In them, he states some of his progressive political ideas for the U.S. The speeches on these recordings were mostly excerpts from addresses Roosevelt had previously given. Transcriptions of these speeches were made both by listening to the recordings and by consulting Social Justice and Popular Rule: Essays, Addresses, and Public Statements Relating to the Progressive Movement (1910-1916) by Theodore Roosevelt.</p> <p>These recordings were originally made on cylinders and were then copied onto 1/4-inch magnetic tape. They were given to the Library of Congress by the Theodore Roosevelt Association in 1982. The recordings are available online in wav and RealAudio formats. </p>'],\n",

       "       'description': ['<p>The fourth in a series of local history collections presented by the National Digital Library Program as part of American Memory, joining <em><a href=\"//memory.loc.gov/ammem/cbhtml/cbhome.html\">\"California As I Saw It\"</a></em>, <em><a href=\"/collections/pioneering-the-upper-midwest/about-this-collection/\">Pioneering the Upper Midwest</a></em>,  and <em><a href=\"/collections/puerto-rico-books-and-pamphlets/about-this-collection/\">Puerto Rico at the Dawn of the Modern Age</a></em>. Together, these online collections make up a virtual local history bookshelf.  Like the other local history collections, <em>The Capital and the Bay</em> comprises first-person narratives, early histories, historical biographies, promotional brochures, and books of photographs in an attempt to capture in words and pictures a distinctive region as it developed between the onset of European settlement and the first quarter of the twentieth century.  Works published after that time generally pose copyright challenges that prevented their inclusion.</p>  <p>In addition to the bay itself, the Chesapeake Bay region is defined for the purposes of this collection as encompassing the portions of Maryland and Virginia from the Atlantic coast to the fall line where the region\\'s west-to-east-flowing rivers \"fall\" from the rolling piedmont to the flat coastal plain.  The region therefore includes the Eastern and Western Shores of the bay as well as the coastal plain in both states; the cities of Annapolis, Baltimore, Cambridge, Easton, and Havre de Grace in Maryland; the city of Washington and its environs, including the whole of the District of Columbia; and the cities of Alexandria, Fredericksburg, Norfolk, Hampton Roads, Petersburg, and Richmond in Virginia. These places share similarities in geography, economic life, and history because of the presence and influence of the bay and its tributaries. </p>  <p>They have also shared the historical influence of Washington, D.C., which as the nation\\'s capital has had a powerful effect upon the whole of the region surrounding it.  In the beginning, its regional impact was minor, for it was then the seat of government of a nation located on the fringe of the European world.  However, rapid growth in the wealth, size, and population of the United States was reflected in the evolution of a small provincial capital into a burgeoning center of national and world politics.  The ties that bind city and region are perhaps most dramatically illustrated in two wars whose theatres of action included the bay region.  The first was the War of 1812, when the British succeeded in burning Washington, only to be rebuffed by the U.S. forces protecting Baltimore at Fort McHenry.  The second is of course the Civil War, in which Richmond, as capital of the Confederacy, lay so close to Washington that it blocked the way south and created strategic and symbolic challenges for the Union Army of the Potomac.</p>  <p><em>The Capital and the Bay: Narratives of Washington and the Chesapeake Bay Region, ca. 1600-1925</em> comprises 139 books selected from the Library of Congress\\'s General Collections and two books from its Rare Book and Special Collections Division.  The selections were made by Steve McCollum, Jurretta Jordan Heckscher, Christopher Pohlhaus,  and Elizabeth Gettins.  In addition to the constraints of copyright date noted above, three criteria governed the selection of works for the collection: whether the work was a primary source reflecting the character of local or regional history; whether the work was a first-person narrative by an inhabitant of the region; and, finally, whether it relayed a perspective on an event of note through the eyes of a contemporary observer.  These follow closely the criteria used in previous local history collections from American Memory.</p>  <p>As in previous collections, there are regrettable limitations in the range of voices one can hear in this collection.  Most obviously, there is a dearth of works from Native Americans, African Americans, and other racial and ethnic minorities arising from the circumstances of history that severely constrained the number of books published by members of these groups during the time the collection covers.  Certainly there were people in these groups who did publish, however, and within the confines of the selection criteria such works have been included whenever possible.</p>'],\n",

The first product of this collaboration,\\xa0<em>The World of 1898: The Spanish-American War</em>, came online in 1998.\\xa0<em>Puerto Rico at the Dawn of the Modern Age</em>\\xa0now joins it, while also expanding the Library of Congress's continuing commitment to highlight the histories of distinctive American regions through the online presentation of materials selected from a number of divisions.</p> <p><em>Puerto Rico at the Dawn of the Modern Age</em>\\xa0encompasses historically important writings by prominent Puerto Rican political activists and historians dating from approximately seventy years before the Spanish-American war (1831) until some thirty years after it (1929). Texts from the postwar period include the only English-language works in the collection. Among these are soldiers' reminiscences about the conflict and short histories designed to acquaint an American audience with Puerto Rico in the earliest years of its affiliation with the United States.</p> <p>The collection comprises 11 monographs scanned from printed copies and 39 political pamphlets and 2 monographs and a journal scanned from microfilm. The pamphlets are part of the Puerto Rican Memorial Collection, 1846-1907, a collection of 447 pamphlets microfilmed in 1994 that covers agriculture and botany, economics, education, government, politics, history, literature, legal materials, and public health. Reels 13 (addresses, essays, laws, and political parties) and 14 (politics and government) are featured in\\xa0<em>Puerto Rico at the Dawn of the Modern Age</em>. All pamphlets are in Spanish. Four of the books are in English and the rest in Spanish. The materials in the collection were selected by Edmundo Flores, a curator in the Hispanic Division.</p> <p><em>Puerto Rico at the Dawn of the Modern Ag</em>e does not present a socially comprehensive view of Puerto Rican history during the period it covers. The books and pamphlets in this collection were written by educated men of European descent whose perspectives inevitably differed from the viewpoints of those less privileged in Puerto Rican society at the time. Individuals of African descent, and to a lesser extent women, seldom had access to the education or technology that would have enabled them to leave published records of their thoughts, deeds, and daily life.</p>\"],\n",

There are extensive interviews with local residents on the seasonal harvesting of natural resources--ginseng, ramps (wild leeks), berries, nuts, fish, and game--on occupations, including coal mining and lumbering; and on the impact of large scale industries such as logging and mountaintop removal mining on local communities. Cultural and religious community events were a focus of the project, including storytelling, community dinners and foodways, baptisms, and cemetery customs. </p> <p>Functioning as a de facto commons, the mountains have supported a way of life that for many generations has entailed hunting, gathering, and subsistence gardening, as well as coal mining and lumbering. This commons, articulated through stories, place names, artifacts, and seasonal practices, powerfully evokes collective memory and anchors community life. The commons is situated in what is known as the mixed mesophytic forest, a temperate-zone hardwood system unrivaled for its biological diversity. Consequently it supports an unusually diverse seasonal round of activities. </p> <p>The Coal River Folklife Collection (AFC 1999/008) consists of approximately 290 audio cassettes, 13,647 still photographs, five Hi-8 videocassettes, and 26 linear feet of print material including administrative correspondence, photo and recording logs, tape transcriptions, field notes, maps, publications, and ephemera. All this material, together with a complete project inventory, is available to researchers in the American  Folklife  Center's Folklife Reading Room at the Library of Congress.</p> <p> Mary Hufford, the field project director and curator for the online collection, collaborated with the late science writer John Flynn, of Rock Creek, West   Virginia, and with photographers Lyntha Scott Eiler and Terry Eiler, to create the sound recordings and photographic images comprising the core of the collection. The Coal River Folklife Project was conducted in cooperation with the Lucy Braun Association for the Mixed Mesophytic Forest and Trees for the Planet, with funding from the Lila Wallace Reader's Digest Fund for Folk Culture, and with the support of the Coal River Mountain Watch, based in Whitesville, West Virginia. Support from the National Park Service is gratefully acknowledged for documentation undertaken on the Coal River in 1993 as a part of the American Folklife Center's New River Gorge Folklife Project.</p>\"],\n",

       "       'description': ['<p>Portrays the states of Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin from the  seventeenth to the early twentieth century through first-person  accounts, biographies, promotional literature, local histories,  ethnographic and antiquarian texts, colonial archival documents, and  other works drawn from the Library of Congress\\'s General Collections and  Rare Books and Special Collections Division.  The collection\\'s 138  volumes depict the land and its resources; the conflicts between  settlers and Native peoples; the experience of pioneers and  missionaries, soldiers and immigrants and reformers; the growth of local  communities and local cultural traditions; and the development of  regional and national leadership in agriculture, business, medicine,  politics, religion, law, journalism, education, and the role of women. </p>  <figure class=\"image-align-right\">   <a href=\"/resource/g4060.ct003546/\"><img src=\"/collections/static/pioneering-the-upper-midwest/images/regional-map.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a>   <figcaption><a href=\"/item/2011589605/\">Regional Map</a> (1873)</figcaption>  </figure>  <p>The online books in this digital collection  are made up of the digitized page images and  transcribed, searchable text of some of the books from the Library of  Congress\\'s General  Collections and (in a few cases) its Rare Book and Special Collections  Division.  Each book is also described in a bibliographic record that  links to the searchable text and page images.  Users can look at the  facsimile images of a book\\'s pages to read it just as they would if they  held the real book in their hands; or they can search or browse or read  the book\\'s text in its electronic transcription.</p>  <p>This collection starts from the recognition that digital technology  offers uniquely powerful tools for exploiting the extensive holdings of  regional, state and local history materials in the Library of Congress\\'s  General Collections.   Following a digital collection of <a href=\"http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/cbhtml/cbhome.html\">books on the early history of California</a>, <em>Pioneering the Upper Midwest: Books from Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, ca. 1820-1910</em> becomes the second installment in a virtual local history bookshelf  that will bring some of these riches to students, teachers, scholars,  and lifelong learners throughout the nation.</p>  <p>Although it contains matter enough for in-depth study of the history  of any one of the states it covers, the collection was conceived with a  regional focus.  Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin each have  fascinating individual histories, but they also have so much in common,  both historically and geographically, that looking at them in relation  to each other offers important perspectives on the experience of place,  time and culture in North America.  What sorts of primary sources can  the Library\\'s General Collections offer about the developing identity of  an entire region, one that is both literally and figuratively central  to the story of the nation\\'s past?  That is the question from which this  digital collection grew.</p>  <p>Generous and enthusiastic financial support from the <a href=\"http://www.WKKF.org/\" target=\"_blank\">W. K. Kellogg Foundation <i class=\"icon icon-external-link\"><span>External</span></i></a> was the crucial component that made the collection possible.  From the  beginning, also, the  collection was able to depend on the support of expert resources both  inside and outside the  Library.  Once the Kellogg grant had guaranteed that the idea for the  collection would become a reality, the selection of materials to be  included began in earnest in 1995 under the guidance of the late Judith  Austin, head of the Library\\'s <a href=\"//lcweb.loc.gov/rr/genealogy/\">Local History and Genealogy Reading Room</a>.   Anne Toohey and Barbara Walsh, reference librarians, compiled an  initial list of choices, which was refined and expanded with the expert  advice of Richard Hulsey and Jane Ratner of the Willard Public Library  in Battle Creek, Michigan; Michael Fox and Patrick Coleman of the  Minnesota Historical Society; Ann Regan of  the Minnesota Historical  Society Press; and James Hensen of the Wisconsin Historical Society.   Additional choices were made by Jurretta J. Heckscher, Steve McCollum,  and Elisabeth H. Null, of the National Digital Library Program at the  Library of Congress.</p>  <p>The major principle governing selection was the desire to reflect the  character of local or regional history, generally through first-person  accounts in as broad as possible a range of voices.  Many of the volumes  in the final selection meet this criterion.  Yet it also became clear  that other kinds of documents could also be valuable components of the  digital collection: biographies, certain reference works, early  ethnographic literature, promotional literature designed to entice  settlers and travellers, even a book of cartoons.  These too made their  way into the collection. Finally, though the works included were all  published between the early nineteenth and the early twentieth century,  some were created much earlier.  Around the turn of the twentieth century, all three state historical societies published compilations of  older historical documents about the region\\'s Native and colonial  history.  These offered a superb resource for deepening the collection\\'s  scope in topic and in time, and several volumes from these historical  society serials have been chosen accordingly.</p>  <p>This digital collection has certain limitations, enforced by  historical circumstances and practical  necessities.  A number of choices had to be ruled out because of  copyright considerations.  Only a handful of works published after 1920  could be included, and before 1920 the published record produced by the  region\\'s Native peoples, for example, is very small.  Native Americans  are therefore represented in the collection primarily through white  peoples\\' eyes.  Moreover, while the pre-1920 holdings of Upper  Midwestern materials in the Library\\'s General Collections are extensive,  they cannot be regarded as absolutely comprehensive, and there are some  identifiable gaps.  One might wish, for example, for more books that  reflect the importance of the Lutheran presence in the development of  the region\\'s religious identity, or more works reflecting the Cornish or  Slovenian or Finnish or Croatian immigrant experience.  The physical  condition of some other books prevented their inclusion.  Even under the  best of circumstances, scanning subjects very fragile books to an  unacceptable amount of stress, and it cannot capture the full images of  pages that are very tightly bound.  A few desirable volumes that fell  into these categories had therefore to be excluded. Finally, this  digital collection is a showcase for materials in the General  Collections.  The handful of Rare Book items included is a welcome  bonus, but the shape of the collection should not be taken to represent  the full range of relevant materials held by the Rare Book and Special  Collections Division.</p>'],\n",

Approximately 3,000 glass plate negatives crafted by Butcher record the process of settlement in Nebraska between 1886 and 1912. Butcher photographed actively in central Nebraska including Custer, Buffalo, Dawson and Cherry counties. The approximately 3,000 pages of Oblinger family letters discuss land, work, neighbors, crops, religious meetings, problems with grasshoppers, financial problems, and the Easter Blizzard of 1873. Uriah Oblinger came from Indiana to Fillmore County, Nebraska in 1873 to claim a homestead for his family. In the eloquent letters exchanged between Uriah and his wife Mattie, and in letters to other family members, Oblinger expresses very personal insight into the joy, despair, and determination in their struggle to establish a home on the prairie. </p>'],\n",

       "       'description': ['<p>Includes 41 motion pictures and 28 sound recordings, motion pictures produced from 1945 to 1965 by Leslie Stewart (owner of the Ninety-Six Ranch), 2,400 still photographs drawn from the Center\\'s ethnographic field project conducted 1978-1982 and from historic photos dating 1870-1958. Background essays provide historical and cultural context for this distinctive northern Nevada ranching community. <em>Buckaroos in Paradise: Ranching Culture in Northern Nevada, 1945-1982</em> presents documentation of a Nevada cattle-ranching community, with a focus on the family-run Ninety-Six Ranch. The focus was on the work of buckaroos, as cowboys are commonly called in the region. </p> <p>Paradise Valley is the name of both a cattle-ranching valley and a crossroads community in northern Nevada\\'s Humboldt County. It is home to persons of Anglo American, Italian, German, Basque, Swiss, Northern Paiute Indian, and Chinese heritage. The valley is a cul-de-sac formed by the Santa   Rosa Mountains and watered by their melting snows. Miners and agriculturists arrived at about the time of the Civil War, but the mines played out by the end of the century and the valley was devoted to ranching through the 1980s. Ranching has continued even as improved technology has again made the extraction of gold profitable and mining has been revived. </p> <p>The documentation for this online collection was largely drawn from the work of an ethnographic field research project in Paradise  Valley, Nevada conducted by the American Folklife Center from 1978 to 1982. The project documented more than thirty ranches and numerous other sites and activities, resulting in extensive collection of administrative papers, printed materials, and collected ephemera; 45,300 color and black-and photos; 150 hours of sound recorded interviews; four hours of l6mm motion picture film; one hour of historic motion picture footage (copied to video); and 10 hours of video recordings. The Paradise Valley Folklife Project collection (AFC 1991/021) is available to researchers in the Folklife Reading Room. </p> <p>The Paradise Valley Folklife Project employed a team of researchers representing different disciplines who documented a variety of aspects of traditional life. Howard W. \"Rusty\" Marshall, then of the Folklife Center\\'s staff, directed the project. Richard E. Ahlborn documented ranch crafts and horse gear. Marshall and Ahlborn co-authored the publication that accompanied the exhibition (<em>Buckaroos in Paradise</em>. Washington: Library of Congress, 1980. Reprint, Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1981). Thomas Vennum Jr. interviewed Northern Paiute Indians about their work as ranch hands and buckaroos. James Deetz led a group of historical archeologists (Eugene Prince, Lynn Eisenmann, and Jamey Deetz) in a survey of the valley\\'s former Chinese community and two historic archeological sites on the Ninety-Six Ranch. Margaret Sermons Purser continued to research the early history of the community, culminating in her doctoral dissertation \"Community and Material Culture in Nineteenth Century Paradise Valley,  Nevada\" (Ph.D. diss., University of California, 1987) (AFC 1987/047). Carl Fleischhauer \\xa0participated in various roles, notably organizing the project\\'s overall media documentation effort, compiling information about Leslie J. \"Les\" Stewart and his Ninety-Six Ranch, and producing a videodisc about the ranch, now transformed into this online collection. Fleischhauer was joined in producing media documentation by William H. \"Bill\" Smock, a filmmaker from San Francisco, who worked as a still photographer and produced the motion pictures included in this online collection.</p> <p>The project team also included specialist researchers contracted by the Folklife Center. Keith Cunningham documented oral traditions in the town of Paradise Valley. He and his wife, Kathy Cunningham, also prepared a comprehensive index to the field research project\\'s 150 hours of tape recordings. Linda Gastañaga studied the Basque presence. Suzi Jones studied foodways and material culture. William A. \"Bert\" Wilson studied the annual cycle of work on several valley ranches. </p> <p>During 1983-1985, materials were selected from the project collection for a laser videodisc. In its first version, the disc provided an interactive video display in the 1983 Library of Congress exhibition The American Cowboy, and in its final form two years later, it became a publication of the American  Folklife  Center entitled <em>The Ninety-Six: A Cattle Ranch in Northern Nevada</em>. The content and structure of the videodisc forms the basis for this online collection. </p>'],\n",
